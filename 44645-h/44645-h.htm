  <p><i>Being convinc'd that nothing has gone farther in Debauching the Age than the</i> Stage
  Poets, <i>and</i> Play-House, <i>I thought I could not employ my time better than in writing
  against them. These Men sure</i>, take Vertue and Regularity, <i>for</i> great Enemies, <i>why
  else is their</i> Disaffection <i>so very</i> Remarkable? <i>It must be said, They have made
  their</i> Attack <i>with great</i> Courage, <i>and</i> gain'd <i>no inconsiderable</i> Advantage.
  <i>But it seems</i> Lewdness without Atheism, <i>is but</i> half their Business. Conscience
  <i>might possibly recover, and</i> Revenge <i>be thought on; and therefore like</i> Foot-Pads,
  <i>they must not only</i> Rob, <i>but</i> Murther. <i>To do them right</i> their Measures
  <i>are</i> Politickly taken: <i>To make sure work on't, there's nothing like</i> Destroying of
  Principles; Practise <i>must</i> follow <i>of</i> Course. <i>For to have</i> no good Principles,
  <i>is to have</i> no Reason to be Good. <i>Now 'tis not to be expected that people should</i>
  check <i>their</i> Appetites, <i>and</i> balk <i>their</i> Satisfactions, <i>they don't know why.
  If</i> Virtue <i>has no</i> Prospect, <i>'tis not worth the owning. Who would be</i> troubled
  <i>with</i> Conscience <i>if 'tis only a</i> Bugbear, <i>and has nothing</i> in't <i>but</i>
  Vision, <i>and the</i> Spleen?</p>

  <p><i>My</i> Collection <i>from the</i> English Stage, <i>is much short of what</i> They <i>are
  able to furnish. An</i> Inventory <i>of their</i> Ware-House <i>would have been a large</i> Work:
  <i>But being afraid of over charging the</i> Reader, <i>I thought a</i> Pattern <i>might
  do</i>.</p>

  <p><i>In</i> Translating <i>the</i> Fathers, <i>I have endeavour'd to keep</i> close <i>to
  their</i> Meaning: <i>However, in</i> some few places, <i>I have taken the</i> Liberty of throwing
  in a Word or two; <i>To</i> clear <i>the</i> Sense, <i>to</i> preserve <i>the</i> Spirit <i>of
  the</i> Original, <i>and keep the</i> English <i>upon its Legs</i>.</p>

  <p><i>There's one thing more to acquaint the</i> Reader <i>with; 'Tis that I have Ventured to</i>
  change <i>the</i> Terms <i>of</i> Mistress <i>and</i> Lover, <i>for</i> others <i>somewhat
  more</i> Plain, <i>but much more</i> Proper. <i>I don't look upon This as any</i> failure
  <i>in</i> Civility. <i>As</i> Good <i>and</i> Evil <i>are</i> different <i>in</i> Themselves,
  <i>so they ought to be</i> differently Mark'd. <i>To</i> confound <i>them in</i> Speech, <i>is the
  way to</i> confound <i>them in</i> Practise. Ill Qualities <i>ought to have</i> ill Names, <i>to
  prevent their being</i> Catching. <i>Indeed</i> Things <i>are in a great measure</i> Govern'd
  <i>by</i> Words: <i>To</i> Guild <i>over a foul</i> Character, <i>serves only to perplex the</i>
  Idea, <i>to encourage the</i> Bad, <i>and mislead the</i> Unwary. <i>To treat</i> Honour,
  <i>and</i> Infamy <i>alike, is an</i> injury <i>to</i> Virtue, <i>and a sort of</i> Levelling
  <i>in</i> Morality. <i>I confess, I have no</i> Ceremony <i>for</i> Debauchery. <i>For to</i>
  Compliment Vice, <i>is but</i> one Remove <i>from</i> worshipping <i>the</i> Devil.</p>

  <h1 class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.8ex;"><span class="larger">THE INTRODUCTION.</span></h1>

  <p class="sp5">The business of <i>Plays</i> is to recomend Virtue, and discountenance Vice; To
  shew the Uncertainty of Humane Greatness, the suddain Turns of Fate, and the Unhappy Conclusions
  of Violence and Injustice: 'Tis to expose the Singularities of Pride and Fancy, to make Folly and
  Falsehood contemptible, and to bring every Thing that is Ill Under Infamy, and Neglect. This
  Design has been oddly pursued by the English <i>Stage</i>. Our <i>Poets</i> write with a different
  View, and are gone into an other Interest. 'Tis true, were their Intentions fair, they might be
  <i>Serviceable</i> to this <i>Purpose</i>. They have in a great measure the Springs of Thought and
  Inclination in their Power. <i>Show</i>, <i>Musick</i>, <i>Action</i>, and <i>Rhetorick</i>, are
  moving Entertainments; and rightly employ'd would be very <span class="pagenum"
  id="page2">{2}</span>significant. But Force and Motion are Things indifferent, and the Use lies
  chiefly in the Application. These Advantages are now, in the Enemies Hand, and under a very
  dangerous Management. Like Cannon seized they are pointed the wrong way, and by the Strength of
  the Defence the Mischief is made the greater. That this Complaint is not unreasonable I shall
  endeavour to prove by shewing the Misbehaviour of the <i>Stage</i> with respect to
  <i>Morality</i>, and <i>Religion</i>. Their <i>Liberties</i>, in the Following Particulars are
  intolerable. <i>viz.</i> Their <i>Smuttiness</i> of <i>Expression</i>; Their <i>Swearing</i>,
  <i>Profainness</i>, and <i>Lewd Application of Scripture</i>; Their <i>Abuse</i> of the
  <i>Clergy</i>; Their <i>making</i> their <i>Top Characters Libertines</i>, and giving them
  <i>Success</i> in their <i>Debauchery</i>. This Charge, with some other Irregularities, I shall
  make good against the <i>Stage</i>, and shew both the <i>Novelty</i> and <i>Scandal</i> of the
  <i>Practise</i>. And first, I shall begin with the <i>Rankness</i>, and <i>Indecency</i> of their
  <i>Language</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page3">{3}</span></div>

  <h1 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.8ex;"><span class="larger"><span class="gsp">CHAP</span>.
  I.</span></h1>

  <h2 class="sp3"><i>The Immodesty of the</i> Stage.</h2>

  <p>In treating this Head, I hope the Reader does not expect that I should set down Chapter and
  Page, and give him the Citations at Length. To do this would be a very unacceptable and Foreign
  Employment. Indeed the Passages, many of them, are in no Condition to be handled: He that is
  desirous to see these Flowers let him do it in their own Soil: 'Tis my business rather to kill the
  <i>Root</i> than <i>Transplant</i> it. But that the Poets may not complain of Injustice; I shall
  point to the Infection at a Distance, and refer in General to <i>Play</i> and <i>Person</i>.</p>

  <p>Now among the Curiosities of this kind we may reckon Mrs. <i>Pinchwife</i>, <i>Horner</i>, and
  Lady <i>Fidget</i> in the <i>Country Wife</i>; Widdow <i>Blackacre</i> and <i>Olivia</i> in the
  <i>Plain Dealer</i>. These, tho' not all the exceptionable <i>Characters</i>, are the most
  remarkable. I'm sorry the Author should stoop his Wit thus Low, and use his Understanding so
  unkindly. Some People <span class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span>appear Coarse, and Slovenly out
  of Poverty: They can't well go to the Charge of Sense. They are Offensive like Beggars for want of
  Necessaries. But this is none of the <i>Plain Dealer</i>'s case; He can afford his Muse a better
  Dress when he pleases. But then the Rule is, where the Motive is the less, the Fault is the
  greater. To proceed. <i>Jacinta</i>, <i>Elvira</i>, <i>Dalinda</i>, and <i>Lady Plyant</i>, in the
  <i>Mock Astrologer</i>, <i>Spanish Friar</i>, <i>Love Triumphant</i> and <i>Double Dealer</i>,
  forget themselves extreamly: And almost all the <i>Characters</i> in the <i>Old Batchelour</i>,
  are foul and nauseous. <i>Love</i> for <i>Love</i>, and the <i>Relapse</i>, strike sometimes upon
  this <i>Sand</i>, and so likewise does <i>Don Sebastian</i>.</p>

  <p>I don't pretend to have read the <i>Stage</i> Through, neither am I Particular to my Utmost.
  Here is quoting enough unless 'twere better: Besides, I may have occasion to mention somewhat of
  this kind afterwards. But from what has been hinted already, the Reader may be over furnish'd.
  Here is a large Collection of Debauchery; such <i>Pieces</i> are rarely to be met with: 'Tis
  Sometimes painted at Length too, and appears in great Variety of Progress and Practise. It wears
  almost all sorts of Dresses to engage the Fancy, and fasten upon the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page5">{5}</span>Memory, and keep up the Charm from Languishing. Sometimes you have it in
  Image and Description; sometimes by way of Allusion; sometimes in Disguise; and sometimes without
  it. And what can be the Meaning of such a Representation, unless it be to Tincture the Audience,
  to extinguish Shame, and make Lewdness a Diversion? This is the natural Consequence, and therefore
  one would think 'twas the Intention too. Such Licentious Discourse tends to no point but to stain
  the Imagination, to awaken Folly, and to weaken the Defences of Virtue: It was upon the account of
  these Disorders that <i>Plato</i> banish'd Poets his <i>Common Wealth</i>: And one of the
  <i>Fathers</i> calls <i>Poetry</i>, <i>Vinum Dæmonum</i> an intoxicating <i>Draught</i>, made up
  by the Devils <i>Dispensatory</i>.</p>

  <p>I grant the Abuse of a Thing is no Argument against the use of it. However Young people
  particularly, should not entertain themselves with a Lewd Picture; especially when 'tis drawn by a
  Masterly Hand. For such a Liberty may probably raise those Passions which can neither be
  discharged without Trouble, nor satisfyed without a Crime: 'Tis not safe for a Man to trust his
  Virtue too far, for fear it should give <span class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}</span>him the slip!
  But the danger of such an Entertainment is but part of the Objection: 'Tis all Scandal and
  meanness into the bargain: it does in effect degrade Human Nature, sinks Reason into Appetite, and
  breaks down the Distinctions between Man and Beast. Goats and Monkeys if they could speak, would
  express their Brutality in such Language as This.</p>

  <p>To argue the Matter more at large.</p>

  <p>Smuttiness is a Fault in Behaviour as well as in Religion. 'Tis a very Coarse Diversion, the
  Entertainment of those who are generally least both in Sense, and Station. The looser part of the
  <i>Mob</i>, have no true relish of Decency and Honour, and want Education, and Thought, to furnish
  out a gentile Conversation. Barrenness of Fancy makes them often take up with those Scandalous
  Liberties. A Vitious Imagination may blot a great deal of Paper at this rate with ease enough: And
  'tis possible Convenience may sometimes invite to the Expedient. The Modern Poets seem to use
  <i>Smut</i> as the Old Ones did <i>Machines</i>, to relieve a fainting Invention. When
  <i>Pegasus</i> is jaded, and would stand still, he is apt like other <i>Tits</i> to run into every
  Puddle.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page7">{7}</span></div>

  <p>Obscenity in any Company is a rustick uncreditable Talent; but among Women 'tis particularly
  rude. Such Talk would be very affrontive in Conversation, and not endur'd by any Lady of
  Reputation. Whence then comes it to Pass that those Liberties which disoblige so much in
  Conversation, should entertain upon the <i>Stage</i>. Do the Women leave all the regards to
  Decency and Conscience behind them when they come to the <i>Play-House</i>? Or does the Place
  transform their Inclinations, and turn their former Aversions into Pleasure? Or were Their
  pretences to Sobriety elsewhere nothing but Hypocrisy and Grimace? Such Suppositions as these are
  all Satyr and Invective: They are rude Imputations upon the whole Sex. To treat the Ladys with
  such stuff is no better than taking their Money to abuse them. It supposes their Imagination
  vitious, and their Memories ill furnish'd: That they are practised in the Language of the Stews,
  and pleas'd with the Scenes of Brutishness. When at the same time the Customs of Education, and
  the Laws of Decency, are so very cautious, and reserv'd in regard to Women: I say so very
  reserv'd, that 'tis almost a Fault for them to Understand they are ill Used. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page8">{8}</span>They can't discover their Disgust without disadvantage, nor Blush without
  disservice to their Modesty. To appear with any skill in such Cant, looks as if they had fallen
  upon ill Conversation; or Managed their Curiosity amiss. In a word, He that treats the Ladys with
  such Discourse, must conclude either that they like it, or they do not. To suppose the first, is a
  gross Reflection upon their Virtue. And as for the latter case, it entertains them with their own
  Aversion; which is ill Nature, and ill Manners enough in all Conscience. And in this Particular,
  Custom and Conscience, the Forms of Breeding, and the Maxims of Religion are on the same side. In
  other Instances Vice is often too fashionable; But here a Man can't be a Sinner, without being a
  Clown.</p>

  <p>In this respect the <i>Stage</i> is faulty to a Scandalous degree of Nauseousness and
  Aggravation. For</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> The <i>Poets</i> make <i>Women</i> speak Smuttily. Of This the Places before
  mention'd are sufficient Evidence: And if there was occasion they might be Multiplyed to a much
  greater Number: Indeed the <i>Comedies</i> are seldom clear of these Blemishes: And sometimes you
  have them in <i>Tragedy</i>. For Instance. <span class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span>The
  <i>Orphans Monimia</i> makes a very improper Description; And the Royal <i>Leonora</i> in the
  <i>Spanish Friar</i>, runs a strange Length in the History of Love <i>p.</i> 50. And, do
  Princesses use to make their Reports with such fulsom Freedoms? Certainly this <i>Leonora</i> was
  the first Queen of her Family. Such raptures are too Lascivious for <i>Joan</i> of <i>Naples</i>.
  Are these the <i>Tender Things</i> Mr. <i>Dryden</i> says the Ladys call on him for? I suppose he
  means the <i>Ladys</i> that are too Modest to show their Faces in the <i>Pit</i>. This
  Entertainment can be fairly design'd for none but such. Indeed it hits their Palate exactly. It
  regales their Lewdness, graces their Character, and keeps up their Spirits for their Vocation: Now
  to bring Women under such Misbehaviour is Violence to their Native Modesty, and a Mispresentation
  of their Sex. For Modesty as Mr. <i>Rapin</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Reflect upon Aristot.
  &amp;c.</i><br/>
  <i>Eurip. Hippolit.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref1"><a href="#side1">[1]</a></sup>
  observes, is the <i>Character</i> of Women. To represent them without this Quality, is to make
  Monsters of them, and throw them out of their Kind. <i>Euripides</i>, who was no negligent
  Observer of Humane Nature, is always careful of this Decorum. Thus <i>Phædra</i><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref2"><a href="#side2">[2]</a></sup> when possess'd with an infamous Passion,
  takes all imaginable pains to conceal it. She is as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page10">{10}</span>regular and reserv'd in her Language as the most virtuous Matron. 'Tis
  true, the force of Shame and Desire; The Scandal of Satisfying, and the difficulty of parting with
  her Inclinations, disorder her to Distraction. However, her Frensy is not Lewd; She keeps her
  Modesty even after She has lost her Wits. Had <i>Shakespear</i> secur'd this point for his young
  Virgin <i>Ophelia</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Hamlet.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref3"><a href="#side3">[3]</a></sup> the <i>Play</i> had been better contriv'd. Since he was
  resolv'd to drown the Lady like a Kitten, he should have set her a swimming a little sooner. To
  keep her alive only to sully her Reputation, and discover the Rankness of her Breath, was very
  Cruel. But it may be said the Freedoms of Distraction go for nothing, a Feavour has no Faults, and
  a Man <i>non Compos</i>, may kill without Murther. It may be so: But then such People ought to be
  kept in dark Rooms and without Company. To shew them, or let them loose, is somewhat unreasonable.
  But after all, the Modern <i>Stage</i> seems to depend upon this Expedient. Women are sometimes
  represented <i>Silly</i>, and sometimes <i>Mad</i>, to enlarge their Liberty, and screen their
  Impudence from Censure: This Politick Contrivance we have in <i>Marcella</i>,<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Don Quixot. Relapse. Love for Love.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref4"><a href="#side4">[4]</a></sup> <i>Hoyden</i>,<sup class="handonly" id="ref5"><a
  href="#side5">[5]</a></sup> and Miss <i>Prue</i>.<sup class="handonly" id="ref6"><a
  href="#side6">[6]</a></sup> However <span class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}</span>it amounts to
  this Confession; that Women when they have their Understandings about them ought to converse
  otherwise. In fine; Modesty is the distinguishing Vertue of that Sex, and serves both for Ornament
  and Defence: Modesty was design'd by Providence as a Guard to Virtue; And that it might be always
  at Hand, 'tis wrought into the Mechanism of the Body. 'Tis likewise proportioned to the occasions
  of Life, and strongest in Youth when Passion is so too. 'Tis a Quality as true to Innocence, as
  the Sences are to Health; whatever is ungrateful to the first, is prejudicial to the latter. The
  Enemy no sooner approaches, but the Blood rises in Opposition, and looks Defyance to an Indecency.
  It supplys the room of Reasoning, and Collection: Intuitive Knowledge can scarcely make a quicker
  Impression; And what then can be a surer Guide to the Unexperienced? It teaches by suddain
  Instinct and Aversion; This is both a ready and a powerful Method of instruction. The Tumult of
  the Blood and Spirits, and the Uneasiness of the Sensation, are of singular Use. They serve to
  awaken Reason, and prevent surprize. Thus the Distinctions of Good and Evil are refresh'd, and the
  Temptation kept at proper Distance.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page12">{12}</span></div>

  <p><i>2ly.</i> They Represent their single Ladys, and Persons of Condition, under these Disorders
  of Liberty, This makes the Irregularity still more Monstrous and a greater Contradiction to
  Nature, and Probability: But rather than not be Vitious, they will venture to spoil a Character.
  This mismanagement we have partly seen already. <i>Jacinta</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Mock
  Astrologer. Old Batchelour.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref7"><a
  href="#side7">[7]</a></sup> and <i>Belinda</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref8"><a
  href="#side8">[8]</a></sup> are farther proof. And the <i>Double Dealer</i> is particularly
  remarkable. There are but <i>Four</i> Ladys in this <i>Play</i>, and <i>Three</i> of the biggest
  of them are Whores. A Great Compliment to Quality to tell them there is not above a quarter of
  them Honest! This was not the Roman Breeding, <i>Terence</i> and <i>Plautus</i> his Strumpets were
  Little people; but of this more hereafter.</p>

  <p><i>3dly.</i> They have oftentimes not so much as the poor refuge of a Double Meaning to fly to.
  So that you are under a necessity either of taking Ribaldry or Nonsence. And when the Sentence has
  two Handles, the worst is generally turn'd to the Audience. The Matter is so Contrived that the
  Smut and Scum of the Thought rises uppermost; And like a Picture drawn to <i>Sight</i>, looks
  always upon the Company.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page13">{13}</span></div>

  <p><i>4ly.</i> And which is still more extraordinary: the <i>Prologues</i>, and <i>Epilogues</i>
  are sometimes Scandalous to the last degree.<span class="leftmar"><i>Mock Astrologer. Country
  Wife. Cleomenes. Old Batchelour.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref9"><a
  href="#side9">[9]</a></sup> I shall discover them for once, and let them stand like Rocks in the
  Margin. Now here properly speaking the <i>Actors</i> quit the <i>Stage</i>, and remove from
  Fiction, into Life. Here they converse with the <i>Boxes</i>, and <i>Pit</i>, and address directly
  to the Audience. These Preliminarie and concluding Parts, are design'd to justify the Conduct of
  the <i>Play</i>, and bespeak the Favour of the Company. Upon such Occasions one would imagine if
  ever, the Ladys should be used with Respect, and the Measures of Decency observ'd, But here we
  have Lewdness without Shame or Example: Here the <i>Poet</i> exceeds himself. Here are such
  Strains as would turn the Stomach, of an ordinary Debauchee, and be almost nauseous in the
  <i>Stews</i>. And to make it the more agreeable, Women are Commonly pick'd out for this Service.
  Thus the <i>Poet</i> Courts the good opinion of the Audience. This is the Desert he regales the
  Ladys with at the Close of the Entertainment: It seems He thinks They have admirable Palats!
  Nothing can be a greater Breach of Manners then such Liberties as these. If a Man would <span
  class="pagenum" id="page14">{14}</span>study to outrage <i>Quality</i> and Vertue, he could not do
  it more Effectually. But</p>

  <p><i>5thly.</i> Smut is still more insufferable with respect to Religion. The Heathen Religion
  was in a great Measure a <i>Mystery</i> of <i>Iniquity</i>. Lewdness was Consecrated in the
  Temples, as well as practised in the <i>Stews</i>. Their Deitys were great Examples of Vice, and
  worship'd with their own Inclination. 'Tis no wonder therefore their Poetry should be tinctured
  with their Belief, and that the <i>Stage</i> should borrow some of the Liberties of their
  Theology. This made <i>Mercurys</i> Procuring, and <i>Jupiters</i> Adultery the more passable in
  <i>Amphitrion</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Plaut.</i><br/>
  <i>Cistellar.</i><br/>
  <i>Terent. Eunuch.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref10"><a href="#side10">[10]</a></sup>:
  Upon this Score <i>Gymnasium</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref11"><a href="#side11">[11]</a></sup>
  is less Monstrous in Praying the Gods to send her store of Gallants. And thus <i>Chæræa</i><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref12"><a href="#side12">[12]</a></sup> defends his Adventure by the
  Precedent of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Danæ</i>. But the Christian Religion is quite of an other
  Complexion. Both its Precepts, and Authorities, are the highest discouragement to Licentiousness.
  It forbids the remotest Tendencies to Evil, Banishes the Follies of Conversation, and Obliges up
  to Sobriety of Thought. That which might pass for Raillery, and Entertainment in Heathenism, is
  detestable in Christianity. The Restraint of the Precept, and the Quality of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page15">{15}</span>Deity, and the Expectations of Futurity quite alter the
  Case.</p>

  <p>But notwithstanding the Latitudes of Paganism, the Roman and Greek <i>Theatres</i> were much
  more inoffensive than ours. To begin with <i>Plautus</i>. This Comedian, tho' the most
  exceptionable, is modest upon the Comparison. For</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> He rarely gives any of the above mention'd Liberties to Women; And when there are
  any Instances of the contrary, 'tis only in prostituted and Vulgar People; And even these, don't
  come up to the Grossness of the <i>Modern Stage</i>.</p>

  <p>For the Purpose. <i>Cleæreta</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Asinar.</i><br/>
  <i>Cistellar.</i><br/>
  <i>Bacchid.</i><br/>
  <i>Casin.</i><br/>
  <i>Mercat. Act. 3.</i><br/>
  <i>Persa.</i><br/>
  <i>Trucul.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref13"><a href="#side13">[13]</a></sup> the
  Procuris borders a little upon Rudeness: <i>Lena</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref14"><a
  href="#side14">[14]</a></sup> and <i>Bacchis</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref15"><a
  href="#side15">[15]</a></sup> the Strumpet are Airy and somewhat  over-merry, but not <i>A
  l'Anglois</i> obscene. <i>Chalinus</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref16"><a
  href="#side16">[16]</a></sup> in Womans Cloaths is the most remarkable. <i>Pasicompa Charinus</i>
  his Wench talks too freely to <i>Lysimachus</i>;<sup class="handonly" id="ref17"><a
  href="#side17">[17]</a></sup> And so does <i>Sophroclidisca</i> <i>Slave</i> to
  <i>Lemnoselene</i>.<sup class="handonly" id="ref18"><a href="#side18">[18]</a></sup> And lastly:
  <i>Phronesiam</i> a Woman of the <i>Town</i> uses a double entendre to <i>Stratophanes</i>.<sup
  class="handonly" id="ref19"><a href="#side19">[19]</a></sup> These are the most censurable
  Passages, and I think all of them with relation to Women; which considering how the World goes is
  very moderate. Several of <i>our</i> Single <i>Plays</i> shall far out-do all This put together.
  And yet <i>Plautus</i> has upon the <span class="pagenum" id="page16">{16}</span>matter left us 20
  entire <i>Comedies</i>. So that in short, these Roman Lasses are meer <i>Vestal Virgins</i>,
  comparatively speaking.</p>

  <p><i>2ly.</i> The <i>Men</i> who talk intemperately are generally <i>Slaves</i>; I believe
  <i>Dordalus</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Persa.</i><br/>
  <i>Trinum.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref20"><a href="#side20">[20]</a></sup> the Pandar,
  and <i>Lusiteles</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref21"><a href="#side21">[21]</a></sup> will be
  found the only exception: And this latter young Gentleman; drops but one over airy expression: And
  for this Freedom, the Poet seems to make him give Satisfaction in the rest of his Character. He
  disputes very handsomly by himself against irregular Love; The Discourse between him and
  <i>Philto</i> is instructive and well managed.<span class="leftmar"><i>Act. 2. 1.</i><br/>
  <i>Act. 2. 2.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref22"><a href="#side22">[22]</a></sup> And
  afterwards he gives <i>Lesbonicus</i> a great deal of sober advice,<sup class="handonly"
  id="ref23"><a href="#side23">[23]</a></sup> and declaims heartily against Luxury and Lewdness! Now
  by confining his Rudeness to little People, the Fault is much extenuated. For First, the
  representation is more Naturally this way; And which is still better, 'tis not so likely to pass
  into Imitation: Slaves and Clowns are not big enough to spread Infection; and set up an ill
  Fashion. 'Tis possible the <i>Poet</i> might contrive these <i>Pesants Offensive</i> to
  discountenance the Practise. Thus the <i>Heilots</i> in <i>Sparta</i> were made drunk to keep
  Intemperance out of <span class="pagenum" id="page17">{17}</span>Credit. I don't mention this as
  if I approv'd the Expedient, but only to show it a circumstance of Mitigation and Excuse.</p>

  <p>Farther, These <i>Slaves</i> and Pandars, Seldom run over, and play their Gambols before Women.
  There are but Four Instances of this Kind as I remember, <i>Olympio</i>,<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Casin.<br/>
  Mil. Glor.<br/>
  Pers.<br/>
  Trucul.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref24"><a href="#side24">[24]</a></sup>
  <i>Palæstrio</i>,<sup class="handonly" id="ref25"><a href="#side25">[25]</a></sup>
  <i>Dordalus</i>,<sup class="handonly" id="ref26"><a href="#side26">[26]</a></sup> and
  <i>Stratilax</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref27"><a href="#side27">[27]</a></sup> are the Persons.
  And the Women they discourse with, are two of them Slaves, and the third a Wench. But with our
  <i>Dramatists</i>, the case is otherwise. With us <i>Smuttiness</i> is absolute and unconfin'd.
  'Tis under no restraint, of Company, nor has any regard to Quality or Sex. Gentlemen talk it to
  Ladies, and Ladies to Gentlemen with all the Freedom, and Frequency imaginable. This is in earnest
  to be very hearty in the cause! To give Title and Figure to Ill Manners is the utmost that can be
  done. If Lewdness will not thrive under such encouragement it must e'en Miscarry!</p>

  <p><i>4ly.</i> <i>Plautus</i> his <i>Prologues</i> and <i>Epilogues</i> are inoffensive. 'Tis
  true, <i>Lambinus</i> pretends to fetch a double <i>entendre</i> out of that to
  <i>P&#x0153;nulus</i>, but I think there is a Strain in the Construction. His <i>Prologue</i> to
  the <i>Captivi</i> is worth the observing.</p>

  <p>We see here the Poet confesses Smut a scandalous Entertainment. That such Liberties ought to
  fall under Neglect, to lie unmention'd, and be blotted out of Memory.</p>

  <p>And that this was not a Copy of his Countenance we may learn from his Compositions. His best
  <i>Plays</i> are almost alwaies Modest and clean Complexion'd. His <i>Amphitrio</i> excepting the
  ungenuine Addition is such. His <i>Epidicus</i> the Master-Piece of his whole Collection is
  inoffensive Throughout: And so are his <i>Menechmi</i>, <i>Rudens</i>, and <i>Trinummus</i>, which
  may be reckon'd amongst some of his next Best. His <i>Truculentus</i> another fine <i>Play</i>
  (tho' not entire) with a Heathen Allowance, is pretty Passable. To be short: Where he is most a
  Poet, he is generally least a Buffoon. And where the Entertainment is Smut, there is rarely any
  other Dish well dress'd: The <span class="pagenum" id="page19">{19}</span>Contrivance is commonly
  wretched, the Sence lean and full of Quibbles. So that his Understanding seems to have left him
  when he began to abuse it.</p>

  <p>To conclude, <i>Plautus</i> does not dilate upon the Progress, Successes, and Disappointments
  of <i>Love</i>, in the <i>Modern</i> way. This is nice Ground, and therefore He either stands off,
  or walks gravely over it, He has some regard to the Retirements of Modesty, and the Dignity of
  Humane Nature, and does not seem to make Lewdness his Business. To give an Instance.
  <i>Silenium</i> is much gone in Love,<span class="leftmar"><i>Cistellear. A. 1.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref28"><a href="#side28">[28]</a></sup> but Modest withall, tho' formerly
  debauch'd.</p>

  <p>She is sorry her Spark was forced from her, and in Danger of being lost. But then she keeps
  within compass and never flies out into Indecency. <i>Alcesimarchus</i> is strangely smitten with
  this <i>Silenium</i>, and almost distracted to recover her.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. A.
  2.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref29"><a href="#side29">[29]</a></sup> He is uneasy and
  blusters, and threatens, but his Passion goes off in Generals. He Paints no Images of his
  Extravagance, nor descends to any nauseous particulars.</p>

  <p>And yet after all, <i>Plautus</i> wrote in an Age not perfectly refin'd, and often seems to
  design his <i>Plays</i> for a Vulgar Capacity. 'Twas upon this view I <span class="pagenum"
  id="page20">{20}</span>suppose his <i>Characters</i> exceed Nature, and his ill Features are drawn
  too large: His old Men over credulous, his Misers Romantick, and his Coxcombs improbably singular.
  And 'tis likely for this reason his <i>Slaves</i> might have too much Liberty.</p>

  <p><i>Terence</i> appear'd when Breeding was more exact, and the <i>Town</i> better polish'd; And
  he manages accordingly: He has<span class="leftmar"><i>Heauton.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref30"><a href="#side30">[30]</a></sup> but one faulty bordering Expression, which is that of
  <i>Chremes</i> to <i>Clitipho</i>. This single Sentence apart, the rest of his Book is (I think)
  unsullied and fit for the nicest Conversation. I mean only in referrence to the Argument in Hand,
  for there are things in Him, which I have no intention to warrant. He is Extreamly careful in the
  Behaviour of his Women. Neither <i>Glycerium</i> in <i>Andria</i>, <i>Pamphila</i> in
  <i>Eunuchus</i>, or <i>Pamphila</i> in <i>Adelphi</i>, <i>Phanium</i> in <i>Phormio</i>, or
  <i>Philumena</i> in <i>Hecyra</i>, have any share of Conversation upon the <i>Stage</i>. such
  Freedom was then thought too much for the Reservedness of a Maiden-Character. 'Tis true in
  <i>Heautontimoroumenos</i> the <i>Poets</i> Plot obliged <i>Antiphila</i>, to go under the
  Disguise of <i>Bacchis</i> her Maid. Upon this Occasion they hold a little Discourse together. But
  then <i>Bacchis</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page21">{21}</span>tho' she was a Woman of the
  <i>Town</i>, behaves her self with all the Decency imaginable. She does not talk in the Language
  of her Profession. But commends <i>Antiphila</i> for her Virtue: <i>Antiphila</i> only says how
  constant she has been to <i>Chinia</i>, seems surprised at his Arrival, and salutes him civilly
  upon't, and we hear no more from her. Mr. <i>Dryden</i> seems to refer to this Conduct in his
  Dramatick <i>Poesie</i>. He censures the <i>Romans</i> for making <i>Mutes</i> of their single
  Women. This He calls the <i>Breeding of the Old</i> Elizabeth <i>way, which was for Maids to be
  seen and not to be heard</i>. Under Favour the old Discipline would be very serviceable upon the
  <i>Stage</i>. As matters go, the <i>Mutes</i> are much to few. For certainly 'tis better to say
  nothing, than talk out of Character, and to ill purpose.</p>

  <p>To return. The Virgin injured by <i>Chærea</i> does nothing but weep, and won't so much as
  speak her misfortune to the Women.<span class="leftmar"><i>Eunuch.</i><br/>
  <i>Love Triump.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref31"><a href="#side31">[31]</a></sup> But
  Comedy is strangly improved since that time; For <i>Dalinda</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref32"><a
  href="#side32">[32]</a></sup> has a great deal more Courage, tho' the loss of her Virtue was her
  own Fault.</p>

  <p>But <i>Terence</i> has that regard for Women, that he won't so much as touch upon an ill
  Subject before them. Thus <span class="pagenum" id="page22">{22}</span><i>Chremes</i> was ashamed
  to mention any thing about his Sons Lewdness when his Wife was present.</p>

  <p>The Slaves in this Comedian are kept in order and civilly bred. They Guard and Fence when

  The Poet did not think Littleness and low Education a good Excuse for Ribaldry. He knew Infection
  at the weakest, might seize on some Constitutions: Besides, the Audience was a Superior Presence,
  and ought to be considered. For how Negligent soever People may be at Home, yet when they come
  before their Betters 'tis Manners to look wholsom.</p>

  <p>Now tho' <i>Plautus</i> might have the richer Invention; <i>Terence</i> was always thought the
  more judicious Comedian. His Raillery is not only finer, and his stile better polish'd; but his
  <i>Characters</i> are more just, and he seems to have reach'd farther into Life than the other. To
  take Leave of this Author, even his Strumpets are better behaved than our honest Women, than our
  Women of Quality of the English <i>Stage</i>. <i>Bacchis</i> in <i>Heautontimoroumenos</i> and
  <i>Bacchis</i> in <span class="pagenum" id="page23">{23}</span><i>Hecyra</i>, may serve for
  example. They are both modest, and converse not unbecoming their Sex. <i>Thais</i> the most
  accomplish'd in her way,<span class="leftmar"><i>Eunuch.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref35"><a href="#side35">[35]</a></sup> has a great deal of Spirit and wheadling in her
  Character, but talks no Smut.</p>

  <p>Thus we see with what Caution and Sobriety of Language <i>Terence</i> manages. 'Tis possible
  this Conduct might be his own Modesty, and result from judgment and Inclination. But however his
  Fancy stood, he was sensible the Coarse way would not do. The <i>Stage</i> was then under
  Discipline, the publick <i>Censors</i> formidable, and the Office of the <i>Choragus</i> was
  originally to prevent the Excesses of Liberty.</p>

  <p>To this we may add the <i>Nobless</i> had no Relish for Obscenity; 'twas the ready way to
  Disoblige them.<span class="leftmar"><i>Casaub. Annot. in Curcul. Plauti.</i></span><sup

  <p>The Old <i>Romans</i> were particularly carefull their Women might not be affronted in
  Conversation: For this reason the Unmarried kept off from Entertainments for fear of learning new
  Language.<span class="leftmar"><i>Var. apud. Nonium.</i><br/>

  Woman above the degree of a <i>Slave</i> was treated abroad by any but Relations.<sup
  class="handonly" id="ref39"><a href="#side39">[39]</a></sup> 'Tis probable the old Comedy was
  silenced at <i>Athens</i> upon this Score, as well as for Defamation. For as <i>Aristotle</i><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref40"><a href="#side40">[40]</a></sup> observes the new Set of Comedians
  were much more modest than the former. In this celebrated Republick, if the <i>Poets</i> wrote any
  thing against Religion or Good Manners, They were tryed for their Misbehaviour, and lyable to the
  highest Forfeitures.<sup class="handonly" id="ref41"><a href="#side41">[41]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It may not be amiss to observe that there are no Instances of debauching Married Women, in
  <i>Plautus</i>, nor <i>Terence</i>, no nor yet in <i>Aristophanes</i>. But on our <i>Stage</i> how
  common is it to make a Lord, a Knight, or an Alderman a Cuckold? The Schemes of Success are beaten
  out with great Variety, and almost drawn up into a Science. How many Snares are laid for the
  undermining of Virtue, and with what Triumph is the Victory proclaim'd? The Finess of the
  <i>Plot</i>, and the Life of the Entertainment often lies in these Contrivances. But the
  <i>Romans</i> had a different sence of these Matters, and saw thro' the consequences of them. The
  Government was awake upon the Theatre, and would not suffer the Abuses of Honour, and Family, to
  pass into <span class="pagenum" id="page25">{25}</span>Diversion. And before we part with these
  <i>Comedians</i> we may take notice that there are no Smutty Songs in their <i>Plays</i>; in which
  the <i>English</i> are extreamly Scandalous.<span class="leftmar"><i>Love for Love.</i><br/>
  <i>Love Triump. &amp;c.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref42"><a
  href="#side42">[42]</a></sup> Now to work up their Lewdness with Verse, and Musick, doubles the
  Force of the Mischief. It makes it more portable and at Hand, and drives it Stronger upon Fancy
  and Practice.</p>

  <p>To dispatch the <i>Latins</i> all together. <i>Seneca</i> is clean throughout the Piece, and
  stands generally off from the point of Love. He has no Courting unless in his <i>Hercules
  Furens</i>;<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 14. Ed. Scriv.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref43"><a href="#side43">[43]</a></sup> And here the Tyrant <i>Lycus</i> addresses
  <i>Megara</i> very briefly, and in Modest and remote Language. In his <i>Thebais</i>,
  <i>Oedipus</i>'s Incest is reported at large, but without any choaking Description. 'Tis granted
  <i>Phædra</i> speaks her Passion plainly out, and owns the strength of the Impression, and is far
  less prudent than in <i>Euripides</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Hippol.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref44"><a href="#side44">[44]</a></sup> But tho' her Thoughts appear too
  freely, her Language is under Discipline.</p>

  <p>Let us now Travel from <i>Italy</i> into <i>Greece</i>, and take a view of the Theatre at
  <i>Athens</i>. In this City the <i>Stage</i> had both its beginning and highest Improvement.
  <i>Æschylus</i> was the first who appear'd with any Reputation. His Genius <span class="pagenum"
  id="page26">{26}</span>seems noble, and his Mind generous, willing to transfuse it self into the
  Audience, and inspire them with a Spirit of Bravery. To this purpose his Stile is Pompous,
  Martial, and Enterprizing. There is Drum and Trumpet in his Verse. 'Tis apt to excite an Heroick
  Ardour, to awaken, warm, and push forward to Action. But his Mettal is not always under
  Management. His Inclination for the <i>Sublime</i>; carrys him too far: He is sometimes
  Embarrass'd with <i>Epithites</i>. His Metaphors are too stiff, and far fetch'd; and he rises
  rather in Sound, than in Sence. However generally speaking, his Materials are both shining and
  solid, and his Thoughts lofty, and uncommon. This Tragedian had always a nice regard to Good
  Manners. He knew corrupting the People was the greatest disservice to the Commonwealth; And that
  Publick Ruine was the effect of general Debauchery. For this reason he declines the Business of
  Amours, and declares expresly against it.<span class="leftmar"><i>Aristoph. Ran.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref45"><a href="#side45">[45]</a></sup> Now here we can't expect any length
  of Testimony. His aversion to the subject makes him touch very sparingly upon it. But in this case
  there is no need of much citation. His very Omissions are Arguments, and his Evidence is the
  stronger for being short. That little I meet with shall be produced.</p>

  going to kill her, he Mentions her Cruelty, but waves her Adultery. <i>Euripides</i> approv'd this
  Reservedness and makes his <i>Electra</i> practise it upon the same occasion.<sup class="handonly"
  id="ref47"><a href="#side47">[47]</a></sup> <i>Æschylus</i> in his next Play complements his
  Country with a great deal of Address in the Persons of the <i>Eumenides</i>.<sup class="handonly"
  id="ref48"><a href="#side48">[48]</a></sup> They are very Gentile and Poetical in their
  Civilities: Among other things They wish the Virgins may all Marry and make the Country Populous:
  Here the <i>Poet</i> do's but just glance upon the Subject of Love; and yet he governs the
  Expression with such care, that the wishes contain a Hint to Sobriety, and carry a Face of Virtue
  along with them.</p>

  <p>The <i>Double Dealer</i> runs Riot upon such an Occasion as this; and gives Lord

  and Dependance to <span class="pagenum" id="page28">{28}</span>struggle with: These were
  circumstances of Danger, and might make him the more pressing. He leaves therefore a solemn Charge

  <p>Our <i>Poets</i> I suppose would call this Preaching, and think it a dull Business. However I
  can't forbear saying an honest Heathen is none of the worst Men: A very indifferent Religion well
  Believed, will go a great way.</p>

  <p>To proceed. <i>Sophocles</i> appear'd next upon the <i>Stage</i>, and was in earnest an
  Extraordinary Person. His Conduct is more Artificial, and his Stile more just, than that of
  <i>Æschylus</i>. His Characters are well drawn, and Uniform with themselves: His <i>Incidents</i>,
  are often surprising, and his <i>Plots</i> unprecipitated. There is nothing but what is Great, and
  Solemn Throughout. The Reasoning is well Coloured. The Figures are sometimes Bold, but not
  Extravagant. There are no Flights of Bombast, no Towring above Nature and Possibility: In short,
  Nothing like Don <i>Sebastians</i> Reigning in his <i>Atomes</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Don
  Sebast. p. 12.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref51"><a href="#side51">[51]</a></sup></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page29">{29}</span></div>

  <p>This Tragedian like <i>Æschylus</i> does not often concern himself with <i>Amours</i>, and when
  he does, nothing can be more temperate, and decent. For example where the Incest of <i>Oedipus</i>
  is described,<span class="leftmar"><i>Oedip. Tyran. Ed Steph.</i><br/>
  <i>Antig. 242. 244.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref52"><a href="#side52">[52]</a></sup>
  the Offensiveness of the Idea is screen'd off and broken by Metaphorical and distant Expressions.
  In another <i>Play</i><sup class="handonly" id="ref53"><a href="#side53">[53]</a></sup>
  <i>Creon</i> resolves to put <i>Antigone</i> to Death for presuming to bury <i>Polynices</i>. This
  Lady and <i>Hæmon</i> <i>Creons</i> Son were very far engaged; <i>Hæmon</i> endeavours to disswade
  his Father from <i>Antigones</i> Execution: He tells him the burying her Brother tho' against his
  Order, was a popular Action. And that the People would resent her being punish'd: But never so
  much as mentions his own Concern unless in one Line; which was so obscure that <i>Creon</i>
  misunderstood him. <i>Antigone</i> amongst her other Misfortunes laments her dying Young and
  Single, but says not one word about <i>Hæmon</i>. The <i>Poet</i> takes care not to bring these
  two Lovers upon the <i>Stage</i> together, for fear they might prove unmanagable? Had They been
  with us, they had met with kinder treatment. They might have had Interviews and Time and Freedom
  enough. Enough to mud their Fancy, to tarnish their Quality, and make their Passion Scandalous. In
  the Relation of <i>Hæmons</i> Death, his Love is related too, and that with all the Life and
  <i>Pathos</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page30">{30}</span>imaginable. But the Description is
  within the Terms of Honour: The tendernesses are Solemn, as well as Soft: They move to <span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. 264.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref54"><a
  href="#side54">[54]</a></sup>Pity and Concern, and go no farther. In his <i>Trachiniæ</i> the
  <i>Chorus</i> owns the Force of Love next to irresistable; gently hints the Intrigues of the Gods,
  and then passes on to a handsome <span class="leftmar"><i>Trach. 348.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref55"><a href="#side55">[55]</a></sup>Image of the Combat between
  <i>Achelous</i> and <i>Hercules</i>. We see how lightly the <i>Poet</i> touches upon an amorous
  Theme: He glides along like a Swallow upon the Water, and skims the Surface, without dipping a
  Feather.</p>

  <p><i>Sophocles</i> will afford us no more, let us therefore take a view of <i>Euripides</i>. 'Tis
  the Method of this Author to decline the Singularities of the <i>Stage</i>, and to appear with an
  Air of Conversation. He delivers great Thoughts in Common Language, and is dress'd more like a
  Gentleman than a <i>Player</i>. His Distinction lies in the perspicuity of his Stile; In Maxim,
  and Moral Reflection; In his peculiar Happiness for touching the Passions, especially that of
  Pity; And lastly, in exhausting the Cause, and arguing <i>pro</i> and <i>Con</i>, upon the streach
  of Reason. So much by way of Character. And as for the Matter before us He is entirely Ours. We
  have had an Instance or two already in <i>Electra</i> and <i>Phædra</i>: To go on to the rest. In
  his <i>Hippolitus</i> He calls <i>Whoring</i>, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page31">{31}</span>stupidness and playing the Fool. And to be Chast and regular, is with him,
  as well as with <i>Æschylus</i>, <span title="Sôphronein"
  class="fsn">&Sigma;&omega;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu;</span>. As much as to say
  'tis the Consequence of Sence, and right Thinking. <i>Phædra</i> when her Thoughts were
  embarrass'd with <i>Hippolitus</i>, endeavours to disentangle her self by Argument.<span

  Satyr against intemperate Women; she concluded rather to die then dishonour her Husband and Stain

  them appear with Disadvantage. Upon this, the <i>Chorus</i> is transported with the Virtue of her
  Resolution and crys out</p>

  <p>Some Things are dangerous in report, as well as practise, and many times a Disease in the
  Description. This <i>Euripides</i> was aware of and manag'd accordingly, and was remarkably
  regular both in stile, and Manners. How wretchedly do we fall short of the Decencies of
  Heathenism! There's nothing more ridiculous than Modesty on our <i>Stage</i>.<span

  <p>The <i>Play-house</i> at <i>Athens</i> has been hitherto in Order, but are there no Instances
  to the contrary? Do's not <i>Aristophanes</i> take great Liberties and make Women speak
  extraordinary Sentences? He do's so. But his Precedent signifies nothing in the case. For</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> We have both the Reason of the Thing, and all the Advantage of Authority on the
  other side. We have the Practise and Opinion of Men of much greater Sence, and Learning then
  Himself. The best Philosophers and Poets, Criticks and Orators, both Greek and Latin, both Antient
  and Modern, give the Cause against him. But <i>Aristophanes</i> his own <i>Plays</i> are
  sufficient to ruin his Authority. For</p>

  <p><i>1st</i>, He discovers himself a downright Atheist. This Charge will be easily Made <span
  class="pagenum" id="page37">{37}</span>good against him <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'by his', wrongly
  corrected to 'his' by Errata">by</span> Comparing his <i>Nubes</i> with <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'other', corrected by
  Errata">his other</span> <i>Plays</i>. The Design of his <i>Nubes</i> was to expose
  <i>Socrates</i>, and make a Town jest of him. Now this Philosopher was not only a Person of great
  Sence and Probity, but was likewise suppos'd to refine upon the Heathen Theology, to throw off the
  Fabulous part of it, and to endeavour to bring it back to the Standard of Natural Religion. And
  therefore <i>Justin Martyr</i> and some others of the <i>Fathers</i>, look'd on him as a Person of
  no Pagan Belief, and thought he suffer'd for the Unity of the God-Head. This Man
  <i>Aristophanes</i> makes fine sport with as he fancies: He puts him in a Fools Coat, and then
  points at him. He makes <i>Socrates</i> instruct his Disciple <i>Strepsiades</i> in a new
  Religion, and tell him that <i>he did not own the Gods in the vulgar Notion</i>. He brings him in
  elswhere affirming that the <i>Clouds are the only Deities</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Nub. Act.

  <p><i>Socrates</i> goes on with his Lecture of Divinity and declares very roundly that there is no
  such thing as <i>Jupiter</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 106.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref69"><a href="#side69">[69]</a></sup> Afterwards he advances farther, and endeavours <span
  class="pagenum" id="page38">{38}</span>to get <i>Strepsiades</i> under Articles to acknowledge no
  other Gods, but <i>Chaos</i>, the <i>Clouds</i>, and the <i>Tongue</i>.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Nub. p. 110.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref70"><a
  href="#side70">[70]</a></sup> At last the <i>Poet</i> brings the Philosopher to publick Pennance
  for his Singularities. He sets fire to his <i>School</i> for teaching Young People (as he
  pretends) to dispute against Law and Justice; for advancing Atheistick Notions, and burlesquing
  the Religion of the Country.<span class="leftmar"><i>Act. 5. p. 176.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref71"><a href="#side71">[71]</a></sup></p>

  <p>That <i>Socrates</i> was no Atheist is clear from Instances enough. To mention but one. The
  Confidence he had in his <i>Dæmon</i>, or <i>Genius</i> by which he governed his Affairs puts it
  beyond all dispute.<span class="leftmar"><i>Plat. Apol. Socrat.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref72"><a href="#side72">[72]</a></sup> However 'tis plain <i>Aristophanes</i> was not of his
  Religion. The <i>Comedian</i> was by no means for correcting the Common Perswasion. So that he
  must either be an Orthodox Heathen or nothing at all. Let us see then with what Respect he treats
  the Receiv'd <i>Divinities</i>. This <i>Play</i>, where one would not expect it, discovers
  somewhat of his Devotion. In the beginning of it <i>Phidippides</i>, who was a sort or
  <i>New-Market</i> Spark, swears by <i>Jocky Neptune</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Nub. p.
  86.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref73"><a href="#side73">[73]</a></sup> that he had a
  strange Kindness for his Father <i>Strepsiades</i>. upon this the old Man replies; <i>No Jocky, if
  you love me; that Deity has almost undone me</i>. This was making somewhat bold with
  <i>Neptune</i> who was <i>Jupiters</i> Brother, <i>Soveraign</i> of a whole <i>Element</i>, and
  had no <span class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span>less than the Third Share of the Universe!
  Certainly <i>Aristophanes</i> had no Venture at Sea, or else must think the <i>Trident</i>
  signified but very little. But this is meer Ceremony to what follows. In his first <i>Play</i>
  <i>Plutus</i> pretends he had a mind to oblige only Men of Probity, but <i>Jupiter</i> had made
  him blind on purpose that he might not distinguish Honest men from Knaves: For to be plain
  <i>Jupiter</i> had a Pique against Good people. Towards the end of this <i>Comedy Mercury</i> is
  abused by <i>Cario</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Plut. A. 1. Sc. 2.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref74"><a href="#side74">[74]</a></sup> and acts a ridiculous, and lessening part himself.
  Afterwards he complains heavily that since <i>Plutus</i> was cured of his Blindness, the business
  of Sacrifing fell off, and the Gods were ready to starve. This <i>Mercury</i> has the same ill
  Usage with the <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Poets, Knaves',
  corrected by Errata"><i>Poets</i> Knaves</span>, Informers, and Lewd Women; From all this stuff
  put together, his meaning is pretty plain, <i>viz.</i> That Religion was no better than an
  Imposture supported by Art, and Ignorance: And that when Men's Understandings were awake, and
  their Eyes a little open, they would have more discretion than to be at any expence about the
  Gods.</p>

  <p>This I take to be part of the Moral of his Fable. If we look farther into him we shall see more
  of his Mind. His <i>Ranæ</i> makes Merry with the Heathen Scheme of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page40">{40}</span>Heaven and Hell. Here <i>Charon</i> and the <i>Stygian Frogs</i> are
  brought in Comically enough. And that you may understand his opinion more perfectly we are told,
  that He that Bilks his <i>Catamite</i> after a <i>Sodomitical</i> Abuse, is thrown into the Common
  shore of <i>Hades</i>. And what Company do you think he is lodg'd with? Why with those who Perjure
  themselves, with those who Kick their Fathers and Mothers? It seems in the <i>Poets</i> Justice a
  Man might as good be false to his Oath, as to his Lewdness.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ran. p.
  188.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref75"><a href="#side75">[75]</a></sup> To disappoint the
  <i>Stews</i>, is every jot as great a Crime; as to fly in the Face of Nature, and outrage our
  Parents. His Quartering his Malefactors thus critically, was without question on purpose to Banter
  the perswasion of future Punishment. In the same <i>Play</i> <i>Xanthias</i> bids <i>Æacus</i>
  answer him by <i>Jove</i>, <span title="Hos hêmin estin homomastigias"
  class="fsn">&#x1F4D;&sigmaf; &#x1F21;&mu;&#x1F76;&nu; &#x1F10;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F76;&nu;
  &#x1F41;&mu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&gamma;&#x1F77;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>. This
  little Scoundrel of a Slave has the Manners to make <i>Jupiters</i> Quality no better than his
  own. To go on with him: In his <i>Aves</i> he speaks out to purpose. Here <i>Pisthetærus</i> tells
  <i>Epops</i> that if the <i>Birds</i> would build a Castle in the Air, they might intercept the
  Fumes of the Sacrifices, and starve the Gods unless they would come too, and be Tributary. It
  seems the <i>Birds</i> had very good Pretences to execute this project; for they <span
  class="pagenum" id="page41">{41}</span>were ancienter than <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>,  and
  Govern'd before the Gods. And to speak truth were more capable of the Function. Their Adviser goes
  on to inform them,<span class="leftmar"><i>536. 538. 546.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref76"><a href="#side76">[76]</a></sup>  that after they had built their pensile City, and
  fortifyed the Air, their next business was to demand their ancient Soveragnity: If <i>Jupiter</i>
  refused to quit, they were to declare a Holy War against Him, and the rest of the Confederate
  Gods, and to cut off the Communication between Heaven and Earth. <i>Pisthæterus</i><span
  class="leftmar"><i>542.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref77"><a
  href="#side77">[77]</a></sup> grows very warm in his new Interest, and swears by <i>Jove</i> that
  Men ought to Sacrifice to the <i>Birds</i>, and not to <i>Jupiter</i>. And if things came to a
  Rupture, and <i>Jupiter</i> grew Troublesome, he undertakes<span
  class="leftmar"><i>582.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref78"><a
  href="#side78">[78]</a></sup> to send a Detachement of Eagles against Him; with Orders to storm
  his Palace with Flambeaux, and fire it about his Ears. At last to prevent the Calamities of a War,
  <i>Hercules</i> proposes an Accomodation,<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref79"><a href="#side79">[79]</a></sup> and is willing <i>Jupiter</i> should
  Resign. <i>Neptune</i> calls him a Block-head for his pains, because he was Heir at <i>Law</i>,
  and after <i>Jupiters</i> Decease was of Course to succeed in his Dominions: Once more, and I have
  done: In <i>Eirene</i>, <i>Trygæus</i> speaks in a menacing way.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>602.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref80"><a
  href="#side80">[80]</a></sup> That unless <i>Jupiter</i> gave him Satisfaction in his business, he
  would inform <span class="pagenum" id="page42">{42}</span>against Him as a disaffected Person, and
  a betrayer of the Liberties of <i>Greece</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Eiren.</i> 616.</span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref81"><a href="#side81">[81]</a></sup> I might add many other Instances, and
  some more Scandalous than any I have mentioned; But these are sufficient to shew the Authors
  Sentiment: And is it any wonder an Atheist should misbehave himself in point of Modesty? What can
  we expect less from those who laugh at the Being of a God, at the Doctrines of Providence, and the
  Distinctions of Good and Evil? A <i>Sceptick</i> has no notion of Conscience, no Relish for
  Virtue, nor is under any Moral restraints from Hope or Fear. Such a one has nothing to do but to
  consult his Ease, and gratifie his Vanity, and fill his Pocket. But how these Ends are compassed,
  he has no squeamishness, or Scruples about it. 'Tis true when the Methods of Lewdness will Take,
  they are generally most agreeable. This way suits their Talent, and screens their practise, and
  obliges their Malice. For nothing is a greater Eye-sore to these Men, then Virtue and Regularity.
  What a pleasure is it then to be admired for Mischeif, to be reveng'd on Religion, and to see Vice
  prosper and improve under our Hands! To return: Beside <i>Aristophanes</i> Atheisme, I have a
  Second objection to his Authority, and that is want of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page43">{43}</span>Judgment. If we examine his <i>Plays</i> we shall find his Characters
  improper, or ununiform; either wrong at first, or unsteady in the Right. For the purpose. In his
  <i>Nubes. A. 3. S. 3. p. 146. 150</i>. He puts dirty expressions in the Mouth of his Man of
  Probity, makes him declaim vitiously against Vice, and Corrects scurrility with Impudence; Now
  what can be more idle and senceless, than such Conduct as this? Epecially when this <i>Justus</i>
  as he calls him had told them in the beginning of his speech, that People used to be well slash'd
  for such Fooling, when Government and Discipline were in their due Force. The <i>Chorus</i> of his
  <i>Ranæ</i> slides<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 142.</i> <i>p. 200.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref82"><a href="#side82">[82]</a></sup> into the same Inconsistency of Precept, and Practise.
  Farther, in the Progress of this <i>Play</i>; <i>Æschylus</i> falls a rallying contrary to his
  Humour, and jests away his own Arguments at a very unseasonable Juncture, when he was disputing
  for no less prize than the Laureatship. This <i>Tragedian</i> after he had play'd a little with
  the Story of <i>Bellerophon</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>242.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref83"><a href="#side83">[83]</a></sup> goes on in the same strain; And charges
  <i>Euripides</i> that he had furnish'd all sorts of People with Sawciness and Prattle. The
  <i>Schools</i> and <i>Academies</i> were spoil'd by this means; So that the Boys were often
  whip'd, and the Boatswains drubb'd, for <span class="pagenum" id="page44">{44}</span>their
  Chattering.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 244.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref84"><a
  href="#side84">[84]</a></sup> These Comical Levities come with an ill Grace from <i>Æschylus</i>.
  His Character was quite different both in Reality, and in the <i>Play</i> before us. He is all
  along represented as a Person of a serious Temper, of a reserv'd Loftiness, Cholerick, and tender
  of his Honour to an Excess, and almost in a rage at the Affront of a Rival, and being forc'd to
  enter the Lists with <i>Euripides</i>. The case standing thus, neither the Man, nor the Business,
  would admit of Drolling. Another Instance of his want of Conduct we have in his <i><span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'Concianotores',
  corrected by Errata">Concionatores</span></i>. Here <i>Blepyrus</i> and some others of his
  Legislative Assembly, talk at a very dirty insipid rate. The Lowest of the <i>Mob</i>, can hardly
  jest with less Wit, and more Lewdness. And to make their Discourse more remarkable; These douty
  Members were just going to the <i>House</i>, and had their Heads full of the Good of the Nation,
  when they entertain'd themselves thus decently<span class="leftmar"><i>p.</i> [......] <i>p.</i>
  [......]</span><sup class="handonly" id="ref85"><a href="#side85">[85]</a></sup>. And are these
  little Buffoons fit to consult <i>de Arduis Regni, &amp;c.</i> to give Authority to Law, and Rules
  for publick Life? Do's Ribaldry and Nonsence become the Dignity of their Station, and the
  Solemnity of their Office? To make his <i>Parliament-Men</i> play the Fool thus egregiously, must
  needs have a great deal of Decorum, and State-Policy in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page45">{45}</span>Contrivance; And is just as wise as if a <i>Painter</i> should have Drawn
  them in the Habit of <i>Jack-Puddings</i>, and <i>Merry-Andrews</i>. But <i>Aristophanes</i> has
  still higher Flights of Absurdity. He won't so much as spare the Gods but makes them act these
  little Parts of Clownishness and Infamy. <i>Bacchus</i> and <i>Hercules</i> in his <i>Ranæ</i> are
  forced to talk Smut and rally like <i>Link-boys</i>, and do almost all the Tricks of
  <i>Bartholomew-Fair</i>. To mention something that will bear the quoting. <i>Bacchus</i> enquires
  of <i>Hercules</i> the readiest way to <i>Hades</i>, or the other World. He bids him either Hang,
  or Poyson himself, and he can't miss the Road. This is <i>Hercules's</i> Humour to a Tittle! And
  represents him as much to the Life, as an <i>Ape</i> would do the <i>Grand Signior</i> at a
  publick Audience! This with a short Sentence or two of Lewdness,<span class="leftmar"><i>Ranæ</i>
  <i>p. 186.</i> <i>p. 182.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref86"><a

  escaped so; for <i>Bacchus</i> is treated much worse. He appears under the disadvantages of a
  Clownish <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Debaush', corrected by

  title="Original reads 'Enterprizes', corrected

  at a quite different rate of Decency. 'Tis no defence to say <i>Aristophanes</i> wrot Comedy, and
  so was obliged to make his Scenes more diverting. This excuse I say is defective; for a Comedian
  ought to imitate Life and Probability, no less than a Tragedian. To Metomorphose
  <i>Characters</i>, and present Contradictions to Common Belief, is to write, <i>Farce</i> instead
  of <i>Plays</i>. Such Comedians like <i>Thespis</i> ought to have a travelling <i>Stage</i>, and
  take the Air with <i>Porcupines</i> and <i>Dromedaryes</i>. If 'tis said that Gravity and
  greatness do's not suit the Complection and Entertainment of Comedy. To this I answer, that
  therefore the <i>Persons</i> should be chosen accordingly. They should have nothing in their known
  Humour, and Condition too Noble, and solemn for Trifling. 'Tis <i>Horaces</i> advice.</p>

  <p>Let us remember that Operations always resemble the Nature from whence they flow. Great Persons
  should therefore have a correspondent Behaviour assign'd them. To make <i>Beings</i> much Superior
  to the Biggest of Mankind, talk below the Least, is absurd and <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'ridicules', corrected by
  Errata">ridiculous</span>. This <i>Aristophanes</i> seems sensible of in his defence of
  <i>Æschylus</i>. Here <i>Euripides</i> objects to <i>Æschylus</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Ranæ p.
  242.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref89"><a href="#side89">[89]</a></sup> that he was too
  rumbling, noisy, and bombastick, over affecting that which <i>Horace</i> calls</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Ampulla, &amp; sesquipedalia Verba.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>To this <i>Æschylus</i>  Answers, that the Thoughts, and Designs of <i>Heroes</i> must be
  deliver'd in Expressions proportioned to their Greatness. It being likely that the Demi-Gods spoke
  up to their Dignity and Stature: And as they were distinguish'd by the richness of their Habit, so
  they had a more Magnificent Language than other Mortals. To this <i>Euripides</i> replys nothing;
  from whence you may conclude the <i>Poet</i> thought the Apology not unreasonable. In short
  <i>Aristophanes</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page48">{48}</span>had Sense but he does not always
  use it. He is not equal, and uniforme. Sometimes you have him flat and foolish a good while
  together. And where he has Spirit, 'tis oftentimes lavished away to little purpose.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ranæ A. 1. Sc. 1. Concionat.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref90"><a
  href="#side90">[90]</a></sup> His Buffoonery is commonly too strong for his Judgment. This makes
  him let fly his jests without regard to Person or occasion: And thus by Springing the <i>Game</i>
  too soon, the Diversion is lost. I could make several other Material Objections against the
  Conduct of his <i>Plays</i>; But this being not necessary I shall observe in the</p>

  <p><i>3d.</i> Place. That notwithstanding the scandalous Liberty for which <i>Aristophanes</i> is
  so remarkable; yet in his Lucid Intervalls, when Sence and Sobriety return upon him, he pronounces
  against his own Practise. In the contest between <i>Æschylus</i> and <i>Euripides</i>,
  <i>Bacchus</i> is made the Umpire of the Controversie. <i>Æschylus</i> begins with a
  Question,<span class="leftmar"><i>Ranæ p. 238.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref91"><a
  href="#side91">[91]</a></sup> and asks <i>Euripides</i> what 'tis which makes a <i>Poet</i>
  admired? He answers. 'Tis for the address of his Conduct, and the handsome Turns of Morality in
  his Poems. 'Tis because his performance has a tendency to form the Audience to Virtue, and
  Improvement, <i>Æschylus</i> demands of him <span class="pagenum" id="page49">{49}</span>farther;
  But suppose you debauched the Age, and made an Honest and a brave People Lewd, and good for
  nothing, what do you deserve then? Here <i>Bacchus</i> interposes, and crys out, what does he
  deserve? A Halter! pray don't ask so plain a question. And afterwards we are told, that
  <i>Poets</i> are valuable only for describing Things useful, in Life and Religion, for polishing
  Inventions, and setting off great Examples with Lustre, and Advantage.<span class="leftmar"><i>p.
  240.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref92"><a href="#side92">[92]</a></sup> In the progress
  of the Dispute, <i>Æschylus</i> taxes <i>Euripides</i> with being too uncautious in his
  Representations; And tells him that Poets ought to conceal that which is vicious in Story; And
  entertain with nothing but Virtue, and Sobriety: He goes on reprimanding <i>Euripides</i> for his
  Dramatick incests, Strumpets, and Amours: And as for himself, to his best remembrance, He never
  brought any Love-Intrigues upon the Stage.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 242. 244.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref93"><a href="#side93">[93]</a></sup></p>

  <p>This is very significant expostulation: and contains very good Rules for the Trial of the
  <i>Muses</i>: But if the English <i>Stage</i>, should be obliged to this Test; <i>Aristophanes</i>
  must set fire to it, and that with much more reason than to <i>Socrates</i> his <i>School</i>. Now
  that <i>Æschylus</i> spoke <i>Aristophanes</i>'s Sense is pretty plain: For first; As to the
  Business of Love, <i>Aristophanes</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page50">{50}</span>always declines
  it; He never patches up a <i>Play</i> with <i>Courtship</i>, and <i>Whining</i>, tho' he wrote
  nothing but <i>Comedy</i>. In the next place the <i>Chorus</i> which is usually the <i>Poets</i>
  Interpreter, speaks honourably of <i>Æschylus</i> even to a Preference;<span class="leftmar">255.
  267.</span><sup class="handonly" id="ref94"><a href="#side94">[94]</a></sup> And at last Judge
  <i>Bacchus</i> gives Sentence for him.</p>

  <p>Thus we see <i>Aristophanes</i> Confutes his own Lewdness, and comes in Evidence against
  himself. This with the other two Exceptions I have made good against him, are sufficient to take
  off the Force of the <i>Precedent</i>, and make him an insignificant Authority.</p>

  <p>To what I have observ'd from the <i>Stage</i> of the Antients, I could add the Authorities of
  <i>Aristotle</i>, and <i>Quintilian</i>, both extraordinary Persons, but I shall reserve their
  Testimony till Afterwards.</p>

  <p>To come Home, and near our own Times: The English Theatre from Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> to King
  <i>Charles</i> II. will afford us something not inconsiderable to our purpose.</p>

  <p>As for <i>Shakespear</i>, he is too guilty to make an Evidence: But I think he gains not much
  by his Misbehaviour; He has commonly <i>Plautus's Fate</i>, where there is most Smut, there is
  least Sense.</p>

  <p><i>Ben. Johnson</i> is much more reserv'd in his <i>Plays</i>, and declares plainly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page51">{51}</span>for Modesty in his <i>Discoveries</i>, some of his Words
  are these.</p>

  <p>A just Writer whom he calls a <i>True Artificer</i>, will avoid <i>Obscene</i> and
  <i>Effeminate Phrase. Where Manners and Fashions are Corrupted, Language is so too.<span

  Argument, and applies his Reasoning more particularly to the Stage. <i>Poetry</i>, (says he)
  <i>and Picture, both behold Pleasure, and profit, as their common Object, but should abstain from
  all base Pleasures, least they should wholly Err from their End; And while they seek to better
  Men's Minds, Destroy their Manners, Insolent and obscene Speeches, and Jests upon the best Men,
  are most likely to excite Laughter. But this is truly leaping from the Stage to the Tumbrill

  717.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref97"><a href="#side97">[97]</a></sup> More might be
  cited to this purpose, but that may serve for an other Occasion: In the mean time I shall go on to
  <i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Fletcher</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fletchers Faithfull Shepheardess</i> is remarkably Moral, and a sort of Exhortation to
  Chastity. This <i>Play</i> met with ill Judges, 'twas Hiss'd before half <i>Acted</i>, and seems
  to have suffer'd on the account of its Innocence.<span class="leftmar"><i>Beauments</i>, &amp;c.

  class="correction" title="Original reads 'justifying', corrected

  Modesty in <i>Fletcher</i>, so he is commended himself by Mr. <i>Earl</i> for the same
  Quality.<sup class="handonly" id="ref99"><a href="#side99">[99]</a></sup></p>

  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref100"><a
  href="#side100">[100]</a></sup> <i>Fletcher</i> is still more full for the Cause. Indeed nothing
  can be more express. He delivers himself by way of <i>Prologue</i>; where the <i>Poet</i> speaks
  in his own Person. The <i>Prologue</i> to the <i>Woman-Hater</i>, very frankly lets the Audience
  know what they are to expect. <i>If there be any amongst you, (says he) that come to hear
  Lascivious Scenes, let them depart; For I do pronounce this, to the utter discomfort of all
  two-penny Gallery Men, you shall no Bawdry in it.</i> We find in those days Smut was the
  expectation of a Coarse Palate, and relish'd by none but two-penny Customers. In the <i>Knight</i>
  of the <i>Burning Pestle</i>, part of the <i>Prologue</i> runs thus. <i>They were banish'd the
  Theatre at</i> Athens, <i>and from</i> Rome <i>hiss'd, that brought Parasites on the Stage with
  Apish Actions, or Fools with uncivil Habits, or Courtezans with immodest words</i>. Afterwards
  <i>Prologue</i>, who represents a Person, gives us more to the same purpose.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page53">{53}</span></div>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fly far from hence.</i></p>
    <p><i>All private taxes, immodest phrases,</i></p>
    <p><i>Whatever way but look like Vitious.</i></p>
    <p><i>For wicked mirth, never true Pleasure brings;</i></p>
    <p><i>For honest Minds, are pleas'd with honest things.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>I have quoted nothing but Comedy in this Author. The <i>Coronation</i> is another. And the
  <i>Prologue</i> tells you there is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>No Undermirth such as does lard the Scene,</i></p>
    <p><i>For Coarse Delight, the Language here is clean.</i></p>
    <p><i>And confident our Poet bad me say,</i></p>
    <p><i>He'll bate you but the Folly of a Play.</i></p>
    <p><i>For which altho' dull Souls his Pen despise;</i></p>
    <p><i>Who think it yet too early to be wise.</i></p>
    <p><i>The Nobles yet will thank his Muse, at least</i></p>
    <p><i>Excuse him, cause his Thought aim'd at the Best.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>Thus these <i>Poets</i> are in their Judgments clearly ours. 'Tis true their Hand was not
  always steady. But thus much may be aver'd, that <i>Fletcher's</i> later <i>Plays</i> are the most
  inoffensive. This is either a sign of the <i>Poets</i> Reformation; or that the exceptionable
  Passages belonged to <i>Beaumont</i>, who dyed first.</p>

  <p>To these Authorities of our own Nation, I shall add a considerable Testimony out of Mr.
  <i>Corneille</i>. This Author was <span class="pagenum" id="page54">{54}</span>sensible that tho'
  the Expression of his <i>Theodore</i> was altogether unsmutty,<span class="leftmar"><i>Theodore.

  'Yet the bare Idea of Prostitution uneffected, shock'd the Audience, and made the Play miscarry.
  The <i>Poet</i> protests he took great care to alter the natural Complexion of the Image, and to
  convey it decently to the Fancy; and delivered only some part of the History as inoffensively as
  possible. And after all his Screening and Conduct, the Modesty of the Audience would not endure
  that little, the Subject forced him upon. He is positive 'the Comedies St. <i>Augustine</i>
  declaim'd against, were not such as the <i>French</i>. For theirs are not spectacles of Turpitude,
  as that Father justly calls those of his Time. The <i>French</i> generally speaking, containing
  nothing but examples of Innocence, Piety and Virtue.'</p>

  <p>In this Citation we have the Opinion of the <i>Poet</i>, the Practise of the <i>French</i>
  Theatre, and the Sense of that <i>Nation</i>, and all very full to our purpose.</p>

  <p class="sp5">To conclude this <i>Chapter</i>. By what has been offer'd, it appears that the
  <i>Present English Stage</i> is superlatively Scandalous. It exceeds the Liberties of all Times
  and Countries: It has not so much as the poor plea of a <i>Precedent</i>, to which most other ill
  Things may claim a pretence. 'Tis mostly meer Discovery and Invention: A new <span class="pagenum"
  id="page55">{55}</span>World of Vice found out, and planted with all the Industry imaginable.
  <i>Aristophanes</i> himself, how bad soever in other respects, does not amplyfie, and flourish,
  and run through all the Topicks of Lewdness like these Men. The <i>Miscellany Poems</i> are
  likewise horribly Licentious. They are sometimes Collections from Antiquity, and often, the worst
  parts of the worst <i>Poets</i>. And to mend the Matter, the Christian <i>Translation</i>, is more
  nauseous than the <i>Pagan</i> Original. Such stuff I believe was never seen, and suffer'd before.
  In a word, If Poverty and Diseases, the Dishonour of Families, and the Debauching of Kingdoms, are
  such valuable Advantages, then I confess these Books deserve encouragement. But if the Case is
  otherwise, I humbly conceive the Proceeding should be so too.</p>

  II.</span></h1>

  <h2 class="sp3"><i>The Profaness of the</i> Stage.</h2>

  <p>An other Instance of the Disorders of the <i>Stage</i> is their <i>Profaness</i>: This Charge
  may come under these two particulars.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>1st. Their Cursing and Swearing.</i></p>
    <p><i>2dly. Their Abuse of Religion and Holy Scripture.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p><i>1st Their Cursing and Swearing.</i></p>

  <p>What is more frequent then their wishes of Hell, and Confusion, Devils, and Diseases, all the
  Plagues of this World, and the next, to each other? And as for Swearing; 'tis used by all Persons,
  and upon all Occasions: By Heroes, and Paltroons; by Gentlemen, and Clowns: Love, and Quarrels,
  Success, and Disappointment, Temper, and Passion, must be varnish'd, and set off with
  <i>Oaths</i>. At some times, and with some <i>Poets</i> Swearing is no ordinary Releif. It stands
  up in the room of Sense, gives Spirit to a flat Expression, and makes a Period Musical and Round.
  In short, 'tis almost all the <span class="pagenum" id="page57">{57}</span>Rhetorick, and Reason
  some People are Masters of: The manner of performance is different. Some times they mince the
  matter; change the Letter, and keep the Sense,<span class="leftmar"><i>Gad for God.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref102"><a href="#side102">[102]</a></sup> as if they had a mind to steal a
  Swearing, and break the Commandement without Sin. At another time the Oaths are clipt, but not so
  much within the Ring, but that the <i>Image and Superscription</i> are visible. These expedients,
  I conceive are more for variety, then Conscience: For when the fit comes on them, they make no
  difficulty of Swearing at Length. Instances of all these kinds may be met with in the <i>Old
  Batchelour</i>, <i>Double Dealer</i>, and <i>Love for Love</i>. And to mention no more, <i>Don
  Quixot</i>, the <i>Provok'd Wife</i>, and the <i>Relapse</i>, are particularly rampant and
  scandalous. The <i>English Stage</i> exceed their predecessors in this, as well as other Branches
  of immorality. <i>Shakespear</i> is comparatively sober, <i>Ben Jonson</i> is still more regular;
  And as for <i>Beaument</i> and <i>Fletcher</i>, In their <i>Plays</i> they are commonly Profligate
  Persons that Swear, and even those are reprov'd for't. Besides, the Oaths are not so full of Hell
  and Defiance, as in the Moderns.</p>

  <p>So much for matter of Fact: And as for point of Law, I hope there needs not <span
  class="pagenum" id="page58">{58}</span>many words to prove Swearing a Sin: For what is more
  provoking than contempt, and what Sin more contemptuous than common Swearing? what can be more
  Insolent and Irreligious, than to bring in God to attest our Trifles, to give Security for our
  Follies, and to make part of our Diversion? To Play with Majesty and Omnipotence in this manner,
  is to render it cheap and despicable. How can such Customes as these consist with the belief of
  Providence or Revelation? The <i>Poets</i> are of all People most to blame. They want even the
  Plea of <i>Bullies</i> and <i>Sharpers</i>. There's no Rencounters, no starts of Passion, no
  suddain Accidents to discompose them. They swear in Solitude and cool Blood, under Thought and
  Deliberation, for Business, and for Exercise: This is a terrible Circumstance; It makes all
  <i>Malice Prepence</i>, and enflames the Guilt, and the Reckoning.</p>

  <p>And if Religion signifies nothing, (as I am afraid it does with some People) there is Law, as
  well as Gospel against <i>Swearing</i>.  <i>3d Jac. 1 cap. 21.</i> is expresly against the
  <i>Playhouse</i>. It runs thus.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><b>For the preventing and avoiding of the great abuse of the holy Name of God, in
    Stage Plays, Enterludes &amp;c. Be it enacted by our Sovereign Lord &amp;c. That if at any time,
    or times, <span class="pagenum" id="page59">{59}</span>after the End of this present Session of
    Parliament; any Person or Persons do, or shall in any Stage Play, Enterlude, Show, &amp;c.
    Jeastingly or Profanly, speak or use the Holy Name of God, or of Christ</b> Jesus, <b>or of the
    Holy Ghost, or of the Trinity, which are not to be spoken, but with Fear and Reverence; shall
    forfeit for every such offence, by him or them committed, ten pounds: The one Moity thereof to
    the King's Majesty, his Heirs; and Successors, the other Moity thereof to him, or them, that
    will sue for the same in any Court of Record at Westminster, wherein no essoin, protection, or
    wager of Law shall be allow'd.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>By this <i>Act</i> not only direct Swearing, but all vain Invocation of the Name of God is
  forbidden. This <i>Statute</i> well executed would mend the <i>Poets</i>, or sweep the <i>Box</i>:
  And the <i>Stage</i> must either reform, or not thrive upon Profaness.</p>

  <p><i>3dly</i> Swearing in the <i>Playhouse</i> is an ungentlemanly, as well as an unchristian
  Practice. The <i>Ladies</i> make a considerable part of the <i>Audience</i>. Now Swearing before
  Women is reckon'd a Breach of good Behaviour, and therefore a civil Atheist will forbear it. The
  custom seems to go upon this Presumption; that the Impressions of Religion are strongest in Women,
  and more generally spread. And that it must be very disagreeable to them, to hear the Majesty of
  God treated with <span class="pagenum" id="page60">{60}</span>so little respect. Besides: Oaths
  are a boistrous and <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'tempestiuous', corrected
  by Errata">tempestuous</span> sort of Conversation; Generally the effects of Passion, and spoken
  with Noise, and Heat. Swearing looks like the beginning of a Quarrel, to which Women have an
  aversion: As being neither armed by Nature, nor disciplin'd by Custome for such rough Disputes. A
  Woman will start at a Soldiers Oath, almost as much as at the Report of his Pistol: And therefore
  a well Bred Man will no more Swear, than Fight in the Company of Ladies.</p>

  <p>A <i>Second</i> Branch of the Profaness of the <i>Stage</i> is their Abuse of Religion, and
  <i>Holy Scripture</i>. And here sometimes they don't stop short of Blasphemy. To cite all that
  might be Collected of this kind would be tedious. I shall give the <i>Reader</i> enough to
  justifie the Charge, and I hope to abhor the Practice.</p>

  <p>To begin with the <i>Mock-Astrologer</i>. In the First <i>Act</i> the <i>Scene</i> is a
  <i>Chappel</i>; And that the Use of such Consecrated places may be the better understood, the time
  is taken up in Courtship, Raillery, and ridiculing Devotion. <i>Jacinta</i> takes her turn among
  the rest. She Interrupts <i>Theodosia</i>, and cries out: <i>why Sister, Sister&mdash;&mdash;will
  you pray? what injury have I ever done you that you <span class="correction"

  <p>But <i>Dorax</i> was a Renegado, what then? He had renounc'd Christianity, but not Providence.
  Besides; such hideous Sentences ought not to be put in the Mouth of the Devil. For that which is
  not fit to be heard, is not fit to be spoken. But to some people an Atheistical Rant is as good as
  a Flourish of Trumpets. To proceed. <i>Antonio</i> tho' a profess'd Christian, mends the matter
  very little. He is looking on a Lot which he had drawn for his Life: This proving unlucky, after
  the preamble of a Curse or two, he calls it,</p>

  <div class="poem">

  </div>

  <p>Thus the Poet prepares his Bullies for the other World! Hell and Damnation are strange
  entertaining words upon the <i>Stage</i>! Were it otherwise, the Sense in these <span
  class="pagenum" id="page66">{66}</span>Lines, would be almost as bad as the Conscience. The
  <i>Poem</i> warms and rises in the working: And the next Flight is extreamly remarkable:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>Not the last sounding could surprize me more,</i></p>
    <p><i>That summons drowsy Mortals to their doom,</i></p>

  </div>

  <p>Very Solemnly and Religiously express'd! <i>Lucian</i> and <i>Celsus</i> could not have
  ridiculed the Resurrection better! Certainly the Poet never expects to be there. Such a light Turn
  would have agreed much better to a Man who was in the Dark, and was feeling for his Stockings. But
  let those who talk of <i>Fumbling</i> for their Limbs, take care they don't find them too fast. In
  the Fourth <i>Act</i> <i>Mustapha</i> dates his <i>Exaltation to Tumult</i>, <i>from the second
  Night of the Month</i> Abib.<span class="leftmar"><i>Id. p. 83.</i><br/>
  <i>Exod. 12, 13.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref127"><a href="#side127">[127]</a></sup>
  Thus you have the Holy Text abused by Captain <i>Tom</i>; And the Bible torn by the Rabble! The
  Design of this Liberty I can't understand, unless it be to make <i>Mustapha</i> as considerable as
  <i>Moses</i>; and the prevalence of a Tumult, as much a Miracle as the Deliverance out of
  <i>Ægypt</i>. We have heard this Author hitherto in his <i>Characters</i>, let us hear him now in
  his own Person. In his <i>Dedication of Aurenge Zebe</i> he is so hardy as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page67">{67}</span>to affirm that <i>he who is too lightly reconciled after high Provocation,
  may Recommend himself to the World for a Christian, but I should hardly trust him for a
  Friend</i>. And why is a Christian not fit to make a Friend of? Are the Principles of Christianity
  defective, and the Laws of it Ill contriv'd? Are the Interests and Capacities of Mankind
  overlook'd? Did our Great Master bind us to Disadvantage, and make our Duty our Misfortune? And
  did he grudge us all the Pleasures and Securities of Friendship? Are not all these horrid
  Suppositions? Are they not a flat Contradiction to the <i>Bible</i>, and a Satyr on the Attributes
  of the Deity? Our Saviour tells us we must <i>forgive until Seventy times Seven</i>; That is, we
  must never be tired out of Clemency and Good Nature. He has taught us to pray for the Forgiveness
  of our own Sins, only upon the Condition of forgiving others. Here is no exception upon the
  Repetition of the Fault, or the Quality of the Provocation. Mr. <i>Dryden</i> to do him right,
  do's not dispute the Precept. He confesses this is the way to be a Christian: But for all that he
  <i>should hardly trust him for a Friend</i>. And why so? Because the Italian Proverb says, <i>He
  that forgives the second time is a Fool.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref128"><a href="#side128">[128]</a></sup> This Lewd Proverb comes in for
  Authority, <span class="pagenum" id="page68">{68}</span>and is a piece of very pertinent
  Blasphemy! Thus in some Peoples <i>Logick</i> one proof from Atheism, is worth Ten from the <i>New
  Testament</i>. But here the <i>Poet</i> argues no better than he Believes. For most certainly, a
  Christian of all others is best qualified for Friendship. For He that loves his Neighbour as
  himself, and carries Benevolence and Good Nature beyond the Heights of Philosophy: He that is not
  govern'd by Vanity, or Design; He that prefers his Conscience to his Life, and has Courage to
  Maintain his Reason; He that is thus qualified must be a good Friend; And he that falls short, is
  no good Christian. And since the <i>Poet</i> is pleas'd to find fault with Christianity, let us
  examine his own Scheme. <i>Our Minds (says he) are perpetually wrought on by the Temperament of
  our Bodies, which makes me suspect they are nearer Allyed than either our Philosophers, or School
  Divines will allow them to be.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref129"><a href="#side129">[129]</a></sup> The meaning is, he suspects our Souls are nothing
  but Organiz'd Matter. Or in plain English, our <i>Souls</i> are nothing but our Bodies. And then
  when the Body dies you may guess what becomes of them! Thus the Authorities of Religion are
  weaken'd, and the prospect of the other World almost shut up. And is this a likely Supposition for
  Sincerity and good Nature? Do's Honour <span class="pagenum" id="page69">{69}</span>use to rise
  upon the Ruines of Conscience? And are People the best Friends where they have the least Reason to
  be so? But not only the Inclinations to Friendship must Languish upon this Scheme, but the very
  Powers of it are as it were destroy'd. By this Systeme no Man can say his Soul is his own. He
  can't be assured the same Colours of Reason and Desire will last. Any little Accident from
  <i>without</i> may metamorphose his Fancy, and push him upon a new set of Thoughts. <i>Matter</i>
  and <i>Motion</i> are the most Humorsom Capricious Things in Nature; and withall, the most
  Arbitrary and uncontroll'd. And can Constancy proceed from Chance, Choice from Fate, and Virtue
  from Necessity? In short a Man at this rate must be a Friend or an Enemy in spite of his Teeth,
  and just as long as the <i>Atoms</i> please and no longer. Every Change in <i>Figure</i> and
  <i>Impulse</i>, must alter the Idea, and wear off the former Impression. So that by these
  Principles, Friendship will depend on the <i>Seasons</i>, and we must look in the <i>Weather
  Glass</i> for our Inclinations. But this 'tis to Refine upon Revelation, and grow wiser than
  Wisdom! The same Author in his Dedication of <i>Juvenal</i> and <i>Persius</i>, has these words:
  <i>My Lord, I am come to the last Petition of</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page70">{70}</span>Abraham;<span class="leftmar"><i>Ded. p. 51.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref130"><a href="#side130">[130]</a></sup> <i>If there be ten Righteous Lines
  in this vast Preface, spare it for their sake; and also spare the next City because it is but a
  little one</i>. Here the Poet stands for <i>Abraham</i>; and the Patron for God Almighty: And
  where lies the Wit of all this? In the Decency of the Comparison? I doubt not. And for the <i>next
  City</i> he would have spared, he is out in the Allusion. 'Tis no <i>Zoar</i>, but much rather
  <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah</i>, Let them take care the Fire and Brimstone does not follow: And
  that those who are so bold with <i>Abraham</i>'s Petition, are not forced to that of <i>Dives</i>.
  To beg Protection for a Lewd Book in <i>Scripture Phrase</i>, is very extraordinary! 'Tis in
  effect to Prostitute the Holy Rhetorick, and send the <i>Bible</i> to the <i>Brothell</i>! I can
  hardly imagin why these Tombs of Antiquity were raked in, and disturb'd? Unless it were to conjure
  up a departed Vice, and revive the Pagan Impurities: Unless it were to raise the Stench of the
  Vault, and Poyson the Living with the Dead. Indeed <i>Juvenal</i> has a very untoward way with him
  in some of his Satyrs. His Pen has such a Libertine stroak that 'tis a Question whether the
  Practise, or the Reproof, the Age, or the Author, were the more Licentious. He teaches those Vices
  he would <span class="pagenum" id="page71">{71}</span>correct, and writes more like a Pimp, than a
  <i>Poet</i>. And truly I think there is but little of Lewdness lost in the <i>Translation</i>. The
  Sixth and Eleventh <i>Satyrs</i> are Particularly remarkable. Such nauseous stuff is almost enough
  to debauch the <i>Alphabet</i>, and make the Language scandalous. One would almost be sorry for
  the privilege of <i>Speech</i>, and the Invention of <i>Letters</i>, to see them thus wretchedly
  abused. And since the Business must be undertaken, why was not the Thought Blanched, the
  Expression made remote, and the ill Features cast into shadows? I'm mistaken if we have not
  Lewdness enough of our own Growth, without Importing from our Neighbours. No. This can't be. An
  Author must have Right done him, and be shown in his own shape, and Complexion. Yes by all means!
  Vice must be disrobed, and People poyson'd, and all for the sake of Justice! To do Right to such
  an Author is to burn him. I hope Modesty is much better than Resemblance. The Imitation of an ill
  Thing is the worse for being exact: And sometimes to report a Fault is to repeat it.</p>

  <p>To return to his <i>Plays</i>. In <i>Love Triumphant</i>, <i>Garcia</i> makes <i>Veramond</i>
  this Compliment:</p>

  <p>What is meant by his Genius, in this place, is not easy to Discover, only that 'tis something
  which is a better Guard than Heaven. But 'tis no Matter for the Sense, as long as the Profaness is
  clear. In this <i>Act</i>, Colonel <i>Sancho</i> lets <i>Carlos</i> know the old Jew is dead,

  <p>Carl. <i>What Jew?</i></p>

  does the Poet acquaint us with <i>Sanchos</i> Religion? The case is pretty plain: 'tis to give a
  lustre to his Profaness, and make him burlesque St. <i>Luke</i> with the better Grace.
  <i>Alphonso</i> complains to <i>Victoria</i> that <i>Nature doats with Age</i>.<span

  at first: 'Tis very well! We know what <i>Nature</i> means in the Language of Christianity, and
  especially under the Notion of a Law-giver. <i>Alphonso</i> goes on, and compares the Possession
  of Incestuous Love to Heaven. Yes, 'tis <i>Eternity in Little</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>p.

  <p>This belike is the meaning of those Texts, <i>that God is good and Gracious, and slow to anger,

  extremity of his Torture does not fall foul upon Religion. 'Tis true, He shows as much Impatience
  as 'tis possible. His Person, his pain, and the Occasion of it, were very extraordinary. These
  circumstances make it somewhat natural for him to complain above the common rate. The Greatness of
  his Spirit, the Feavour of his Blood, and the Rage of his Passion, could hardly fail of putting

  <p>The greatest part of the Life of this <i>Scene</i> is spent in impious Rants, and Atheistical
  Disputes. To do the Author right, his <i>Characters</i> never want Spirits for such Service,
  either full or Fasting. Some <span class="pagenum" id="page93">{93}</span>people love to say the
  worst Things in the best manner; To perfume their Poysons, and give an Air to Deformity.</p>

  <p>There is one ill Sentence in <i>Sophocles</i> behind. <i>Philoctetes</i> calls the Gods <span
  title="Kakoi" class="fsn">&Kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#x1F78;&iota;</span>, and Libells their
  Administration.<span class="leftmar"><i>Philoct. 402.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref193"><a href="#side193">[193]</a></sup> This Officer we must understand was left upon a
  Solitary Island, ill used by his Friends, and harrass'd with Poverty and Ulcers, for Ten years
  together. These, under the Ignorance of Paganism, were trying Circumstances, and take off somewhat
  of the Malignity of the Complaint. Afterwards He seems to repent,<span
  class="leftmar"><i>419.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref194"><a
  href="#side194">[194]</a></sup> and declares his Assurance that the Gods will do Justice, and
  prays frequently to them. The Conclusion of this Play is remarkably Moral. Here <i>Hercules</i>
  appears in <i>Machine</i>; aquaints <i>Philoctetes</i> with his own glorious Condition; That his
  Happiness was the Reward of Virtue, and the Purchase of Merit. He charges him to pay a due regard
  to Religion; For Piety would recommend him to <i>Jupiter</i> more than any other Qualification. It
  went into the other World with People and they found their Account in't both Living and Dead.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 431.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref195"><a
  href="#side195">[195]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Upon the whole; The <i>Plays</i> of <i>Æschylus</i> and <i>Sophocles</i> are formed upon Models
  of Virtue: They joyn Innocence with <span class="pagenum" id="page94">{94}</span>Pleasure, and
  design the Improvement, of the <i>Audience</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Euripides's Bacchæ, Pentheus</i> is pull'd in pieces for using <i>Bacchus</i> with
  Disrespect. And the <i>Chorus</i> observes that God never fails to punish Impiety, and Contempt of
  Religion.<span class="leftmar"><i>Act. 2.</i><br/>
  <i>p. 295.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref196"><a href="#side196">[196]</a></sup>
  <i>Polyphemus</i> blusters Atheistically, and pretends to be as great as <i>Jupiter</i>: But then
  his Eye is burnt out in the fifth Act.<sup class="handonly" id="ref197"><a
  href="#side197">[197]</a></sup> And the <i>Chorus</i> in <i>Heraclidæ</i> affirm it next to
  Madness not to worship the Gods. I grant he has some profane Passages stand uncorrected, and what
  wonder is it to see a <i>Pagan</i> Miscarry? <i>Seneca</i>, as he was inferiour in Judgment to the
  <i>Greeks</i>, so he is more frequent, and uncautious, in his Flights of extravagance. His Hero's
  and Heroines, are excessively bold with the Superior Beings. They rave to Distraction, and he does
  not often call them to an account for't. 'Tis true <i>Ajax Oileus</i> is made an Example for
  Blaspheming in a Storm. He is first struck with Thunder, and then carried to the Bottom.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Agam. Act. 3.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref198"><a
  href="#side198">[198]</a></sup> The Modern <i>Poets</i>, proceed upon the Liberties of
  <i>Seneca</i>, Their Madmen are very seldom reckon'd with. They are profane without Censure, and
  defie the <i>Living God</i> with success. Nay, in some respect they exceed even <i>Seneca</i>
  himself. He flies out only under Impatience; And never falls into these Fits without <span
  class="pagenum" id="page95">{95}</span>Torture, and hard Usage. But the <i>English Stage</i> are
  unprovok'd in their Irreligion, and Blaspheme for their Pleasure. But supposing the
  <i>Theatres</i> of <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Athens</i> as bad as possible, what Defence is all This?
  Can we argue from <i>Heathenism</i> to <i>Christianity</i>? How can the <i>practise</i> be the
  same, where the <i>Rule</i> is so very different? Have we not a clearer Light to direct us, and
  greater Punishments to make us afraid. Is there no Distinction between Truth and Fiction, between
  Majesty and a Pageant? Must God be treated like an Idol, and the <i>Scriptures</i> banter'd like
  <i>Homers Elysium</i>, and <i>Hesiods Theogonia</i>? Are these the Returns we make Him for his
  Supernatural Assistance? For the more perfect Discovery of Himself, the stooping of his Greatness,
  and the Wonders of his Love. Can't we refuse the Happiness without affronting the Offer? Must we
  add Contempt to Disobedience, and Out-rage to Ingratitude? Is there no Diversion without Insulting
  the God that made us, the Goodness that would save us, and the Power that can damn us? Let us not
  flatter our selves, <i>Words</i> won't go for Nothing. Profaness is a most Provoking Contempt, and
  a Crime of the deepest dye. To break through the Laws of a Kingdom is bad <span class="pagenum"
  id="page96">{96}</span>enough; But to make <i>Ballads</i> upon the <i>Statute-Book</i>, and a Jest
  of Authority, is much worse. Atheists may fancy what they please, but God will <i>Arise and
  Maintain his own Cause</i>, and Vindicate his Honour in due time.</p>

  <p class="sp5">To conclude. Profaness tho' never so well corrected is not to be endured. It ought
  to be Banish'd without <i>Proviso</i>, or Limitation. No pretence of <i>Character</i> or
  Punishment, can excuse it; or any <i>Stage-Discipline</i> make it tolerable. 'Tis grating to
  <i>Christian</i> Ears, dishonourable to the Majesty of God, and dangerous in the Example. And in a
  Word, It tends to no point, unless it be to wear off the horrour of the Practise, to weaken the
  force of Conscience, and teach the Language of the Damn'd.</p>

  <h2 class="sp3"><i>The Clergy abused by the</i> Stage.</h2>

  <p>The Satyr of the <i>Stage</i> upon the <i>Clergy</i> is extreamly Particular. In other cases,
  They level at a single Mark, and confine themselves to Persons. But here their Buffoonry takes an
  unusual Compass; They shoot Chain'd-shot, and strike at Universals. They play upon the
  <i>Character</i>, and endeavour to expose not only the Men, but the Business. 'Tis true, the
  Clergy are no small Rub in the <i>Poets</i> way. 'Tis by their Ministrations that Religion is
  perpetuated, the other World Refresh'd, and the Interest of Virtue kept up. Vice will never have
  an unlimited Range, nor Conscience be totally subdued, as long as People are so easy as to be
  Priest-ridden! As long as these Men are look'd on as the Messengers of Heaven, and the Supports of
  Government, and enjoy their old Pretentions in Credit and Authority; as long as this Grievance
  continues, the <i>Stage</i> must decline of Course, and Atheism give Ground, and Lewdness lie
  under Censure, <span class="pagenum" id="page98">{98}</span>and Discouragment. Therefore that
  Liberty may not be embarrass'd, nor Principles make Head against Pleasure, the <i>Clergy</i> must
  be attack'd, and rendred Ridiculous.</p>

  <p>To represent a Person fairly and without disservice to his Reputation, two Things are to be
  observ'd. First He must not be ill used by others: Nor Secondly be made to Play the Fool Himself.
  This latter way of Abuse is rather the worst, because here a Man is a sort of <i>Felo de se</i>;
  and appears Ridiculous by his own fault. The Contradiction of both these Methods is practised by
  the <i>Stage</i>. To make sure work on't, they leave no stone unturn'd, The whole <i>Common
  place</i> of Rudeness is run through. They strain their Invention and their Malice: And overlook
  nothing in ill Nature, or ill Manners, to gain their point.</p>

  <p>To give some Instances of their Civility! In the <i>Spanish Fryer, Dominick</i> is made a Pimp
  for <i>Lorenzo</i>;<span class="leftmar"><i>20.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref199"><a
  href="#side199">[199]</a></sup> He is call'd <i>a parcel of Holy Guts and Garbage</i>, and said
  <i>to have room in his Belly for his Church steeple</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Dominick</i> has a great many of these Compliments bestow'd upon him. And to make the
  Railing more effectual, you have a general stroke or two upon the Profession. Would you know what
  are the <span class="pagenum" id="page99">{99}</span><i>Infallible Church Remedies</i>. Why 'tis
  to <i>Lie Impudently</i>, and <i>Swear Devoutly</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 37.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref200"><a href="#side200">[200]</a></sup> A little before this
  <i>Dominick</i> Counterfits himself sick, retires, and leaves <i>Lorenzo</i> and <i>Elvira</i>
  together; And then the Remark upon the Intrigue follows. 'You see Madam (says <i>Lorenzo</i>)<span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 23.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref201"><a
  href="#side201">[201]</a></sup> 'tis Interest governs all the World. He Preaches against Sin, why?
  Because he gets by't: He holds his Tongue; why? because so much more is bidden for his Silence.
  'Tis but giving a Man his Price, and Principles of <i>Church</i> are bought off as easily as they
  are in <i>State</i>: No man will be a Rogue for nothing; but Compensation must be made, so much
  Gold for so much Honesty; and then a Church-man will break the Rules of Chess. For the Black
  Bishop, will skip into the White, and the White into the Black, without Considering whether the
  remove be Lawful.</p>

  <p>At last <i>Dominick</i> is discover'd to the Company, makes a dishonourable <i>Exit</i>, and is
  push'd off the <i>Stage</i> by the Rabble. This is great Justice! The Poet takes care to make him
  first a Knave, and then an Example: But his hand is not even. For Lewd <i>Lorenzo</i> comes off
  with <i>Flying Colours</i>. 'Tis not the Fault which is corrected but <span class="pagenum"
  id="page100">{100}</span>the Priest. The Authors Discipline is seldom without a Biass. He commonly
  gives the <i>Laity</i> the Pleasure of an ill Action, and the <i>Clergy</i> the Punishment.</p>

  <p>To proceed. <i>Horner</i> in his general Remarks upon Men, delivers it as a sort of Maxim,
  <i>that your Church-man is the greatest Atheist</i>. In this Play <i>Harcourt</i> puts on the
  Habit of a Divine.<span class="leftmar"><i>Country Wife p. 6.</i></span><sup class="handonly"

  <p>And which is more, <i>Oedipus</i> must be acquainted with his Age, having spent the greatest
  part of his time with him at <i>Corinth</i>. So that in short, the pith of the Story lies in this
  Circumstance. A Prince of Ninety years was dead, and one who was wondred at for dying no sooner.
  And now why so much Exclamation upon this occasion? Why must all the <i>Powers</i> in Being be
  Summon'd in to make the News <span class="pagenum" id="page107">{107}</span>Credible? This
  <i>Posse</i> of <i>Interjections</i> would have been more seasonably raised if the Man had been
  alive; for that by the Poets Confession had been much the stranger Thing. However <i>Oedipus</i>
  is almost out of his Wits about the Matter, and is Urgent for an account of Particulars.</p>

  to the Argument in Hand. In the <i>Provok'd Wife</i> Sir <i>John Brute</i> puts on the Habit of a
  Clergyman, counterfeits himself drunk; quarrels with the <i>Constable</i>, and is knock'd down and
  seiz'd. He rails, swears, curses, is lewd and profane, to all the Heights of Madness and

  insolently Profane, and let it lie: The spirit of this Thought is borrow'd from Ben
  <i>Johnsons</i> <i>Bartholomew-Fair</i>, only the Profaness is mightily improved, and the Abuse
  thrown off the <i>Meeting House</i>, upon the <i>Church</i>. The Wit of the <i>Parents being

  <p>These <i>Poets</i> I observe when They grow lazy, and are inclined to Nonsence, they commonly
  get a Clergy-man to speak it. <span class="pagenum" id="page110">{110}</span>Thus they pass their
  own Dulness for Humour, and gratifie their Ease, and their Malice at once. <i>Coupler</i>
  instructs <i>Young Fashion</i> which way <i>Bull</i> was to be managed. He tells him as
  <i>Chaplains go now, he must be brib'd high, he wants Money, Preferment, Wine, and a Whore. Let

  <p>I could cite more <i>Plays</i> to this purpose; But these are sufficient to show the Temper of
  the <i>Stage</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus we see how hearty these People are in their Ill Will! How they attack Religion under every
  Form, and pursue the Priesthood through all the Subdivisions of Opinion. Neither <i>Jews</i> nor
  <i>Heathens, Turks</i> nor <i>Christians</i>, <i>Rome</i> nor <i>Geneva</i>, <i>Church</i> nor
  <i>Conventicle</i>, can <span class="pagenum" id="page111">{111}</span>escape them. They are
  afraid least Virtue should have any Quarters undisturbed, Conscience any Corner to retire to, or
  God be Worship'd in any Place. 'Tis true their Force seldom carries up to their Malice: They are
  too eager in the Combat to be happy in the the Execution. The Abuse is often both gross and
  clumsey, and the Wit as wretched as the Manners. Nay Talking won't always satisfy them. They must
  ridicule the <i>Habit</i> as well as the Function, of the Clergy. 'Tis not enough for them to play
  the Fool unless they do it in <i>Pontificalibus</i>. The Farce must be play'd in a Religious
  Figure, and under the Distinctions of their Office! Thus the Abuse strikes stronger upon the
  sense; The contempt is better spread, and the little <i>Idea</i> is apt to return upon the same
  Appearance.</p>

  <p>And now does this Rudeness go upon any Authorities? Was the Priesthood alwaies thought thus
  insignificant, and do the Antient Poets palt it in this Manner? This Point shall be tried, I shall
  run through the most considerable Authors that the Reader may see how they treat the Argument.
  <i>Homer</i> stands highest upon the Roll, and is the first Poet both in Time, and Quality; I
  shall therefore begin with him. Tis true he wrote no <span class="pagenum"
  id="page112">{112}</span><i>Plays</i>; but for Decency, Practise, and general Opinion, his
  Judgment may well be taken, Let us see then how the <i>Priests</i> are treated in his <i>Poem</i>,
  and what sort of Rank they hold.</p>

  <p><i>Chryses Apollo</i>'s Priest appears at a Council of War with his Crown and guilt Scepter. He
  offers a valuable Ransom for his Daughter; and presses his Relation to <i>Apollo</i>. All the Army

  But this <i>General</i> refuses to part with the Lady, and sends away her Father with disrespect.
  <i>Apollo</i> thought himself affronted with this Usage, and revenges the Indignity in a

  <p>These are all the <i>Priests</i> I find Mentioned in <i>Homer</i>; And we see how fairly the
  Poet treats them, and what sort of Figure they made in the World.</p>

  <p>To the Testimony of <i>Homer</i>, I shall joyn that of <i>Virgil</i>, who tho' He follows at a
  great distance of Time, was an Author of the first Rank, and wrote the same kind of Poetry with
  the other. Now <i>Virgil</i> tho' he is very extraordinary in his Genius, in the Compass of his
  Learning, in the Musick and Majesty of his Stile; yet the exactness of his Judgment seems to be
  his peculiar, and most distinguishing Talent. He had the truest <span class="pagenum"
  id="page114">{114}</span>Relish imaginable, and always described Things according to
  <i>Nature</i>, <i>Custom</i>, and <i>Decency</i>. He wrote with the greatest Command of
  <i>Temper</i>, and <i>Superiority</i> of good <i>Sense</i>. He is never lost in smoak and Rapture,
  nor overborn with Poetick Fury; but keeps his Fancy warm and his Reason Cool at the same time. Now
  this great Master of Propriety never Mentions any <i>Priests</i> without some <i>Marks</i> of
  <i>Advantage</i>. To give some Instances as they lie in Order.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Trojans</i> were consulting what was to be done with the <i>Wooden-Horse</i>, and
  some were for lodging it within the Walls; <i>Laocoon</i> appears against this Opinion at the Head
  of a numerous Party, harangues with a great deal of Sense, and Resolution, and examines the
  <i>Machine</i> with his Lance. In fine, He advised so well, and went so far in the Discovery of
  the Stratagem; that if the <i>Trojans</i> had not been ungovernable, and as it were stupified by
  Fate and Folly, he had saved the Town.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ænid. 2.</i></span><sup

  call'd <i>Pantheus Otriades</i>, which is an argument his Father was well known. His acquaintance
  with <i>Æneas</i> to whose House he was carrying his little Grandson, argues him to be a Person of
  Condition.<span class="leftmar"><i>Æneid 2.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref237"><a

  <p>When <i>Æneas</i> was outed at <i>Troy</i>, and in quest of a new Country, he came to an Anchor

  gives him many material Directions, and makes him a rich Present at parting. To this Prince if you

  Commanded in Cheif in the <i>Trojan Auxiliaries</i>: So that you may know his Quality by his
  Company. When <i>Æneas</i> had passed on farther, he saw <i>Orpheus</i> in <i>Elysium</i>: The
  Poet calls him the <i>Thracian</i> Priest. There needs not be much said of <i>Orpheus</i>; He is
  famous for his skill in Musick, Poetry, and Religious Ceremonies,<span

  the Country, and had the <i>Priesthood</i> hereditary to their Family. To go on, <i>Æmonides</i>,
  and <i>Chloreus</i> make a glittering Figure in the <i>Feild</i>, and are very remarkable for the
  Curiosity of their Armour, and Habit. <i>Æmonides</i>'s <i>Finery</i> is passed over in

  <p>But the Equipage of <i>Chloreus</i> is flourish'd out at Length, and as I remember admired by
  <i>Macrobius</i> as one of the Master <span class="pagenum" id="page118">{118}</span>peices of
  <i>Virgil</i> in Description. In short; He is all Gold, Purple, Scarlet, and Embroydery;<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Æneid. 11.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref247"><a
  href="#side247">[247]</a></sup> and as rich as Nature, Art, and Rhetorick can make him. To these I
  might add <i>Rhamnes</i>, <i>Asylas</i>, and <i>Tolumnius</i>, who were all Persons of Condition,
  and had Considerable Posts in the Army.<span class="leftmar"><i>Æneid. 9. 10. 11.</i></span><sup

  <p>It may be these last were not strictly <i>Priests</i>. Their Function was rather
  <i>Prophetick</i>. They interpreted the Resolutions of the Gods, by the voice of Birds, the
  Inspection of Sacrifices, and their Observations of Thunder. This made their Character counted
  Sacred, and their Relation to the Deity particular. And therefore the <i>Romans</i> ranged them in
  the <i>Order</i> of the <i>Priests</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Guther. de jure veter.
  pontif.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref249"><a href="#side249">[249]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Thus we see the admired <i>Homer</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>, always treat the <i>Priests</i>
  fairly, and describe them in Circumstances of Credit: If 'tis said that the Instances I have given
  are mostly in Names of <i>Fiction</i>, and in Persons who had no Being, unless in the Poets fancy.
  I answer, I am not concern'd in the History of the Relation. Whether the Muster is true or false,
  'tis all one to my purpose. This is certain, had the <i>Priests</i> been People of such slender
  Consideration as our <i>Stage Poets</i> endeavour to make them; they must have <span
  class="pagenum" id="page119">{119}</span>appear'd in a different Figure; or rather have been left
  out as too little for that sort of <i>Poem</i>. But <i>Homer</i> and <i>Virgil</i> had other
  Sentiments of Matters: They were governed by the Reason of Things, and the common usage of the
  World. They knew the <i>Priesthood</i> a very reputable Employment, and always esteem'd as such.
  To have used the <i>Priests</i> ill, They must have call'd their own Discretion in question: They
  must have run into impropriety, and fallen foul upon Custom, Manners, and Religion. Now 'twas not
  their way to play the Knave and the Fool together: They had more Sense than to do a silly Thing,
  only for the Satisfaction of doing an ill one.</p>

  <p>I shall now go on to enquire what the Greek <i>Tragedians</i> will afford us upon the present
  Subject. There are but two <i>Plays</i> in <i>Æschylus</i> where the <i>Ministers</i> of the Gods
  are represented. The one is in his <i>Eumenides</i>, and here <i>Apollo</i>'s <i>Priestess</i>
  only opens the <i>Play</i> and appears no more. The other is in his <i>Seige</i> of <i>Thebes</i>.
  In this Tragedy the <i>Prophet Amphiaraus</i> is one of the Seven Commanders against the
  <i>Town</i>. He has the Character of a Modest, Brave Officer, and of one who rather affected to be
  great in Action, than Noise.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page120">{120}</span></div>

  <p>In <i>Sophocle</i>'s <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i>, <i>Jupiter's Priest</i> has a short part. He
  appears at the Head of an <i>Address</i>, and delivers the Harangue by the King's Order.
  <i>Oedipus</i> in his Passion treats <i>Tiresias</i> ruggedly;<span class="leftmar"><i>Oedip. Tyr.
  p. 148.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref250"><a href="#side250">[250]</a></sup>
  <i>Tiresias</i> replies with Spirit and Freedom; and plainly tell him he was none of his
  <i>Servant</i> but <i>Apollo</i>'s.</p>

  himself within Temper, and gives no ill Language. And even <span class="pagenum"

  <i>Seneca</i> seems to follow the Conduct of <i>Euripides</i>, and secures <i>Tiresias</i> from
  being outraged. <i>Oedipus</i> carries it smoothly with him and only desires him to out with the
  Oracle, and declare the Guilty Person. This <i>Tiresias</i> excuses, and afterwards the Heat of
  the expostulation falls upon <i>Creon</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Oedip.</i></span><sup

  in those Days 'twas very infamous to affront a <i>Holy Character</i>, and break in upon the
  <i>Guards</i> of Religion! Thus we see how the Antient Poets behaved themselves in the Argument.
  <i>Priests</i> seldom appear in their <i>Plays</i>. And when they come 'tis Business of Credit
  that brings them. They are treated like Persons of Condition. They Act up to their Relation;
  neither sneak, nor prevaricate, nor do any thing unbecoming their Office.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page123">{123}</span></div>

  <p>And now a word or two of the <i>Moderns</i>.</p>

  <p>The famous <i>Corneille</i> and <i>Moliere</i>, bring no <i>Priests</i> of any kind upon the
  <i>Stage</i>. The former leaves out <i>Tiresias</i> in his <i>Oedipus</i>: Tho' this Omission
  balks his Thought, and maims the <i>Fable</i>. What therefore but the regard to Religion could
  keep him from the use of this Liberty? As I am informed the same Reservedness is practis'd in
  <i>Spain</i>, and <i>Italy</i>: And that there is no Theatre in <i>Europe</i> excepting the
  <i>English</i>, that entertains the <i>Audience</i> with <i>Priests</i>.</p>

  <p>This is certainly the right method, and best secures the Outworks of Piety. The Holy Function
  is much too Solemn to be play'd with. Christianity is for no Fooling, neither the <i>Place</i>,
  the <i>Occasion</i> nor the <i>Actors</i> are fit for such a Representation. To bring the
  <i>Church</i> into the <i>Playhouse</i>, is the way to bring the <i>Playhouse</i> into the
  <i>Church</i>. 'Tis apt to turn Religion into <i>Romance</i>, and make unthinking People conclude
  that all Serious Matters are nothing but <i>Farce</i>, <i>Fiction</i>, and <i>Design</i>. 'Tis
  true the <i>Tragedies</i> at <i>Athens</i> were a sort of <i>Homilies</i>, and design'd for the
  Instruction of the People: To this purpose they are all Clean, Solemn, and Sententious.
  <i>Plautus</i> likewise informs us that the <i>Comedians</i> used to teach the People
  Morality.<span class="leftmar"><i>Rud. A. 4. S. 7.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref264"><a
  href="#side264">[264]</a></sup> The <span class="pagenum" id="page124">{124}</span>case standing
  thus 'tis less suprizing to find the <i>Priests</i> sometimes Appear. The Play had grave Argument,
  and Pagan Indulgence, to plead in its behalf. But our <i>Poets</i> steer by an other
  <i>Compass</i>. Their Aim is to <i>destroy</i> Religion, their <i>Preaching</i> is against
  <i>Sermons</i>; and their Business, but Diversion at the best. In short, Let the Character be
  never so well managed no Christian <i>Priest</i> (especially,) ought to come upon the
  <i>Stage</i>. For where the Business is an Abuse, and the place a Profanation; the demureness of
  the Manner, is but a poor excuse. Monsieur <i>Racine</i> is an Exception to what I have observ'd
  in <i>France</i>. In his <i>Athalia</i>, <i>Joida</i> the <i>High-Priest</i> has a large part. But
  then the Poet does him Justice in his Station; he makes him Honest and Brave, and gives him a
  shining Character throughout. <i>Mathan</i> is another <i>Priest</i> in the same Tragedy. He turns
  Renegado, and revolts from God to <i>Baal</i>. He is a very ill Man but makes a considerable
  Appearance, and is one of the Top of <i>Athaliahs</i> Faction. And as for the <i>Blemishes</i> of
  his Life, they all stick upon his own Honour, and reach no farther than his Person: In fine the
  <i>Play</i> is a very Religious Poem; 'Tis upon the Matter all <i>Sermon</i> and <i>Anthem</i>.
  And if it were not designed for the <i>Theatre</i>, I have nothing to object.</p>

  <p>Let us now just look over our own Country-men till King <i>Charles</i> the Second.
  <i>Shakespear</i> takes the Freedom to represent the <i>Clergy</i> in several of his <i>Plays</i>:
  But for the most part he holds up the <i>Function</i>, and makes them neither Act, nor Suffer any
  thing unhandsom. In one Play or two He is much bolder with the <i>Order</i>.<span

  <i>Priest</i> is too Comical and Secular in his Humour. However he understands his Post, and
  converses with the Freedom of a Gentleman. I grant in <i>Loves Labour lost</i> the <i>Curate</i>
  plays the Fool egregiously; And so does the <i>Poet</i> too, for the whole <i>Play</i> is a very
  silly one. In the History of Sr. <i>John Old-Castle</i>, Sr. <i>John, Parson</i> of <i>Wrotham</i>
  Swears, Games, Wenches, Pads, Tilts, and Drinks: This is extreamly bad, and like the Author of the

  Advantage in his Character. He appears Loyal, and Stout; He brings in Sr. <i>John Acton</i>, and
  other Rebels Prisoners. He is rewarded by the King, and the Judge uses him Civilly and with
  Respect. In short He is represented Lewd, but not Little; And the Disgrace falls rather on the
  Person, then the Office. But the <i>Relapsers</i> business, is to sink the Notion, and Murther the
  Character, and make the <span class="pagenum" id="page126">{126}</span>Function despicable: So
  that upon the whole, <i>Shakespear</i> is by much the gentiler Enemy.</p>

  abused by <i>Cutberd</i>, and a little by <i>Morose</i>. But his Lady checks him for the ill
  Breeding of the Usage. In his <i>Magnetick Lady</i>, <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, and <i>Sad

  Leave.</p>

  <p><i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Fletcher</i> in the <i>Faithful Shepheardess</i>, <i>The False one</i>,
  <i>A Wife for a Month</i>, and the <i>Knight of Malta</i>, give, us both <i>Priests</i> and
  <i>Bishops</i>, part Heathen and part Christian: But all of them save their Reputation and make a
  creditable Appearance. The <i>Priests</i> in the <i>Scornful Lady</i>, and <i>Spanish Curate</i>
  are ill used. The first is made a Fool, and the other a Knave. Indeed they seem to be brought in
  on purpose to make sport, and disserve <span class="pagenum" id="page127">{127}</span>Religion.
  And so much for <i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Fletcher</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus we see the English <i>Stage</i> has always been out of Order, but never to the Degree 'tis
  at present.</p>

  <p>I shall now take Leave of the <i>Poets</i>, and touch a little upon History and Argument.</p>

  <p>And here I shall briefly shew the Right the <i>Clergy</i> have to Regard, and fair Usage, upon
  these Three following Accounts.</p>

  <p>I. <i>Because of their Relation to the Deity.</i></p>

  <p>II. <i>Because of the Importance of their Office.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">III. <i>They have prescription for their Privilege. Their function has been in
  Possession of Esteem in all Ages, and Countries.</i></p>

  <p>I. <i>Upon the account of their Relation to the Deity.</i></p>

  <p>The Holy <i>Order</i> is appropriated to the Divine Worship: And a <i>Priest</i> has the
  peculiar Honour to <i>Belong</i> to nothing less then God Almighty. Now the Credit of the
  <i>Service</i> always rises in proportion to the Quality and Greatness of the Master. And for this
  Reason 'tis more Honourable to serve a Prince, than a private Person. To apply this. Christian
  <i>Priests</i> are the Principal Ministers of Gods Kingdom. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page128">{128}</span>They Represent his Person, Publish his Laws, Pass his Pardons, and
  Preside in his Worship. To expose a <i>Priest</i> much more to burlesque his Function, is an
  Affront to the Diety. All indignities done to Ambassadors, are interpreted upon their Masters, and
  reveng'd as such. To outrage the <i>Ministers</i> of Religion, is in effect to deny the Being, or
  Providence of God; And to treat the <i>Bible</i> like a <i>Romance</i>. As much as to say the
  Stories of an other World are nothing but a little <i>Priest-craft</i>, and therefore I am
  resolv'd to Lash the Profession. But to droll upon the Institutions of God; To make his Ministers
  cheap, and his Authority contemptible; To do this is little less than open defyance. Tis a sort of
  Challenge to awaken his Vengeance, to exert his Omnipotence; and do Right to his Honour. If the
  Profession of a Courtier was unfashionable, a Princes Commission thought a Scandal, and the
  <i>Magistracy</i> laught at for their Business; the Monarch had need look to himself in time; He
  may conclude his Person is despis'd, his Authority but a Jest, and the People ready either to
  change their Master, or set up for themselves. Government and Religion, no less than <i>Trade</i>
  Subsist upon Reputation. 'Tis true God can't be Deposed, neither does <span class="pagenum"
  id="page129">{129}</span>his Happiness depend upon Homage; But since he does not Govern by
  Omnipotence, since he leaves Men to their Liberty, Acknowledgment must sink, and Obedience
  decline, in proportion to the Lessenings of Authority. How provoking an Indignity of this kind
  must be, is easy to imagine.</p>

  <p>II. The Functions and Authorities of Religion have a great Influence on <i>Society</i>. The
  Interest of this Life lies very much in the Belief of another. So that if our Hopes were bounded
  with <i>Sight</i>, and <i>Sense</i>, if <i>Eternity</i> was out of the Case, General Advantage,
  and Publick Reason, and Secular Policy, would oblige us to be just to the <i>Priesthood</i>. For
  <i>Priests</i>, and Religion always stand and fall together; Now Religion is the Basis of
  Government, and Man is a wretched Companion without it. When Conscience takes its Leave, Good
  Faith, and Good Nature goes with it. <i>Atheism</i> is all Self, Mean and Mercenary. The
  <i>Atheist</i> has no <i>Hereafter</i>, and therefore will be sure to make the most of this World.
  Interest, and Pleasure, are the Gods he Worships, and to these he'll Sacrifice every Thing
  else.</p>

  <p>III. The <i>Priest-hood</i> ought to be fairly treated, because it has  prescription for this
  Privilege. This is so evident a <span class="pagenum" id="page130">{130}</span>Truth,  that there
  is hardly any Age or Country, but affords sufficient Proof. A just Discourse upon this Subject
  would be a large Book, but I shall just skim it over and pass on. and</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> For the Jews. <i>Josephus</i> tells us the Line of <i>Aaron</i> made some of the
  best Pedigrees, and that the <i>Priests</i> were reckon'd among the Principal Nobility.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>De Bell. Judaic.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref267"><a
  href="#side267">[267]</a></sup></p>

  <p>By the Old <i>Testament</i> we are inform'd that the <i>High-Priest</i> was the Second Person
  in the Kingdom.<span class="leftmar"><i>Deut. 17. 9. 20. 2. Chron. 19. 8.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref268"><a href="#side268">[268]</a></sup> The Body of that <i>Order</i> had
  Civil Jurisdiction. And the <i>Priests</i> continued Part of the Magistracy in the time of our
  Saviour. <i>Jehoiada</i> the <i>High-Priest</i> was thought an Alliance big enough for the Royal
  Family.<span class="leftmar"><i>Math. 27. Act. 4.<br/>
  Vid. seldon de Synedr.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref269"><a
  href="#side269">[269]</a></sup> He Married the Kings Daughter; His Interest and Authority was so
  great that he broke the Usurpation under <i>Athalia</i>; and was at the Head of the Restauration.
  And lastly the <i>Assamonean</i> Race were both Kings and Priests.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Joseph.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref270"><a
  href="#side270">[270]</a></sup></p>

  <p>To Proceed. The <i>Ægyptian</i>  Monarchy was one of the most antient and best polish'd upon
  Record. Here Arts and Sciences, the Improvment of Reason, and the Splendor of Life had its first
  Rise. Hither 'twas that <i>Plato</i> and most of the Celebrated Philosophers travel'd for their
  Learning. Now in this Kingdom the <span class="pagenum" id="page131">{131}</span><i>Priests</i>
  made no vulgar Figure. These with the Military Men were the Body of the Nobility, and Gentry.
  Besides the Business of Religion, the <i>Priests</i> were the Publick <i>Annalists</i> and kept
  the Records of <i>History</i>, and <i>Government</i>. They were many of them bred in Courts,
  formed the Education of their Princes, and assisted at their Councils.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Diod. Sic.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref271"><a
  href="#side271">[271]</a></sup> When <i>Joseph</i> was Viceroy of <i>Ægypt</i>, and in all the
  height of his Pomp, and Power, the King Married him to the Daughter of <i>Potipherah Priest</i> of
  <i>On</i>. The Text says <i>Pharaoh gave him her to Wife</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Gen.
  41.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref272"><a href="#side272">[272]</a></sup> This shows the
  Match was deliberate Choice, and Royal Favour, no stooping of Quality, or Condescensions of Love,
  on <i>Joseph</i>'s Side.</p>

  <p>To pass on. The <i>Persian Magi</i>, and the <i>Druids</i>, of <i>Gaul</i> were of a Religious
  Profession, and consign'd to the Service of the Gods. Now all these were at the upper End of the
  Government, and had a great share of Regard and Authority.<span class="leftmar"><i>Porph. de

  href="#side273">[273]</a></sup> The Body of the <i>Indians</i> as <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> reports
  is divided into Seven parts. The first is the <i>Clan</i> of the <i>Bramines</i>, the
  <i>Priests</i>, and Philosophers of that Country. 'This Division is the least in Number, but the
  first in Degree. Their Privileges are extraordinary. They are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page132">{132}</span>exempted from Taxes, and Live Independent of Authority. They are called
  to the Sacrifices, and take care of Funerals; They are look'd on as the Favourites of the Gods,
  and thought skillful in the Doctrins of an other Life: And upon these accounts are largely
  consider'd in Presents, and Acknowledgment. The <i>Priestesses</i> of <i>Argos</i> were so
  Considerable, that <i>Time</i> is dated from them, and they stand for a Reign in
  <i>Chronology</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Lib. 6.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref274"><a
  href="#side274">[274]</a></sup> The Brave <i>Romans</i> are commended by <i>Polybius</i> for their
  Devotion to the Gods; Indeed they gave great Proof of their being in earnest; For when thier Cheif
  Magistrates, their Consuls themselves, met any of the <i>Vestals</i>, they held down their
  <i>Fasces</i>, and stoop'd their <i>Sword</i> and <i>Mace</i> to Religion.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ser. in Controv.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref275"><a
  href="#side275">[275]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The <i>Priest-hood</i> was for sometime confin'd to the <i>Patrician</i> Order, that is to the
  Upper Nobility. And afterwards the <i>Emperours</i> were generally <i>High-Priests</i> themselves.
  The Romans in distress endeavour'd to make Friends with <i>Coriolanus</i> whom they had banish'd
  before. To this purpose they furnish'd out several <i>Solemn</i> Embasayes. Now the Regulation of
  the Ceremony, and the Remarks of the Historian;<span class="leftmar"><i>Dion.
  Halic.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref276"><a href="#side276">[276]</a></sup> plainly
  discover that the <i>Body</i> of the <i>Priests</i> were thought not inferior <span
  class="pagenum" id="page133">{133}</span>to any other. One Testimony from <i>Tully</i> and I have
  done. 'Tis in his Harangue to the College of the <i>Priests</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Pro Dom.
  ad Pontif.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref277"><a href="#side277">[277]</a></sup> <i>Cum
  multa divinitus, Pontifices, a majoribus nostris inventa atque instituta sunt; tum nihil

  Prudence, and Capacity, I know nothing better contrived then their placing your Order at the Helm,
  and setting the same Persons at the Head both of Religion, and Government.</i> Thus we see what
  <i>Rank</i> the <i>Priest-hood</i> held among the <i>Jews</i>, and how Nature taught the
  <i>Heathen</i> to regard it. And is it not now possess'd of as fair pretences as formerly? Is
  Christianity any disadvantage to the Holy Office. And does the Dignity of a Religion lessen the
  Publick Administrations in't? The <i>Priests of the most High God</i> and of <i>Idolatry</i>,
  can't be compared without Injury. To argue for the Preference is a Reflection upon the
  <i>Creed</i>. 'Tis true the <i>Jewish Priest-hood</i> was instituted by God: But every Thing
  Divine is not of Equal Consideration. <i>Realities</i> are more valuable than <i>Types</i>; And as
  the Apostle argues, the <i>Order</i> of <i>Melchizedeck</i> is greater than that of
  <i>Aaron</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Hebr. 7.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref278"><a
  href="#side278">[278]</a></sup> The Author, (I mean the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page134">{134}</span>immediate one,) the Authorities, the Business, and the End, of the
  <i>Christian Priest-hood</i>, are more Noble than those of the <i>Jewish</i>. For is not
  <i>Christ</i> greater than <i>Moses</i>, <i>Heaven</i> better than the Land of <i>Canaan</i>, and
  the <i>Eucharist</i> to be prefer'd to all the <i>Sacrifices</i>, and <i>Expiations</i> of the
  <i>Law</i>? Thus the Right, and the Reason of Things stands. And as for <i>Fact</i>, the Christian
  World have not been backward in their Acknowledgments. Ever since the first Conversion of Princes,
  the <i>Priest-hood</i> has had no small share of Temporal Advantage. The <i>Codes</i>,
  <i>Novels</i>, and <i>Church History</i>, are Sufficient Evidence what Sense <i>Constantine</i>
  and his Successors had of these Matters. But I shall not detain the <i>Reader</i> in remote
  Instances.</p>

  <p>To proceed then to Times and Countries more generally known. The People of <i>France</i> are
  branched into three Divisions, of these the <i>Clergy</i>, are the First. And in consequence of
  this Privilege, at the Assembly of the <i>States</i>, they are first admitted to Harangue before

  id="ref283"><a href="#side283">[283]</a></sup> In <i>England</i> the <i>Bishops</i> are Lords of
  Parliament: And the <i>Law</i> in plain words distinguishes the <i>Upper House</i> into the
  <i>Spiritual</i> and <i>Temporal Nobility</i>. And several <i>Statutes</i> call the Bishops
  <i>Nobles</i> by direct Implication.<span class="leftmar"><i>2, Hen. 8. cap.  22.</i><br/>

  href="#side284">[284]</a></sup> To mention nothing more, their <i>Heraldry</i> is regulated by
  <i>Garter</i>, and <i>Blazon'd</i> by <i>Stones</i>, which none under the <i>Nobility</i> can
  pretend to. In this Country of ours, Persons of the First Quality have been in <i>Orders</i>; To
  give an Instance of some few. <i>Odo</i> Brother to <i>William</i> the <i>Conquerour</i> was
  <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Baieux</i>, and Earl of <i>Kent</i>. King <i>Stephens</i> Brother was
  <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Winchester</i>. <i>Nevill Arch-Bishop</i> of <i>York</i> was Brother to the
  Great Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, and <i>Cardinal Pool</i> was of the Royal Family. To come a little
  lower, and to our own Times. And here we may reckon not a few Persons of Noble Descent in Holy
  <i>Orders</i>. Witness the <i>Berklyes</i>, <i>Comptons</i>, <i>Montagues</i>, <i>Crews</i>, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page136">{136}</span>and <i>Norths</i>; The <i>Annesleys</i>, <i>Finches</i>,
  <i>Grayhams</i> &amp;c. And as for the Gentry, there are not many good Families in <i>England</i>,
  but either have, or have had a <i>Clergy-man</i> in them,</p>

  <p>In short; The <i>Priest-hood</i> is the profession of a Gentleman. A <i>Parson</i>
  notwithstanding the ignorant Pride of some People, is a Name of Credit, and Authority, both in
  Religion, and <i>Law</i>. The <i>Addition</i> of <i>Clerk</i> is at least equal to that of
  Gentleman. Were it otherwise the <i>Profession</i> would in many cases be a kind of Punishment.
  But the <i>Law</i> is far from being so singular as to make <i>Orders</i> a Disadvantage to
  <i>Degree</i>. No, The Honour of the Family continues, and the <i>Heraldry</i> is every jot as
  safe in the <i>Church</i>, as 'twas in the <i>State</i>. And yet when the <i>Laity</i> are taken
  leave of, not <i>Gentleman</i> but <i>Clerk</i> is usually written. This Custom is an argument the
  Change is not made for the worse, that the Spiritual Distinction is as valuable as the other; And
  to speak Modestly, that the first <i>Addition</i> is not lost, but Cover'd. Did the Subject
  require it, this Point might be farther made good. For the stile of a higher Secular Honour is
  continued as well with <i>Priest-hood</i> as without it. A Church-man who is either <i>Baronet, or
  Baron</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page137">{137}</span>writes himself so, notwithstanding His
  <i>Clerkship</i>. Indeed we can't well imagine the Clergy degraded from Paternal Honour without a
  strange Reflection on the Country; without supposing <i>Julian</i> at the Helm, the <i>Laws</i>
  Antichristian, and <i>Infidelity</i> in the very <i>Constitution</i>. To make the Ministers of
  Religion less upon the score of their Function, would be a Penalty on the <i>Gospel</i>, and a
  contempt of the God of Christianity. 'Tis our Saviours reasoning; <i>He that despises you,
  despises Me, and he that Despises Me, Despises Him that sent me.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>S.
  Luke 12.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref285"><a href="#side285">[285]</a></sup></p>

  <p>I hope what I have offer'd on this Subject will not be misunderstood. There is no Vanity in
  necessary Defence. To wipe off Aspersions, and rescue Things from Mistake, is but bare Justice:
  Besides, where the Honour of God, and the Publick Interest are concern'd, a Man is bound to speak.
  To argue from a resembling Instance. He that has the Kings Commission ought to Maintain it. To let
  it suffer under Rudeness is to betray it. To be tame and silent in such cases, is not Modesty but
  Meanness, Humility obliges no Man to desert his Trust; To throw up his Privilege, and prove false
  to his Character. And is our Saviours Authority inferiour to that of Princes? Are the Kingdoms of
  this World more <span class="pagenum" id="page138">{138}</span>Glorious than that of the next? And
  can the Concerns of Time be greater than those of Eternity? If not, the reasoning above mention'd
  must hold in the Application.</p>

  <p>And now by this time I conceive the ill Manners of the <i>Stage</i> may be in some measure
  apparent; And that the <i>Clergy</i> deserve none of that Coarse Usage which it puts upon them. I
  confess I know no <i>Profession</i> that has made a more creditable Figure, that has better
  Customs for their Privileges, and better Reasons to maintain them. And here setting aside the
  point of Conscience, where lies the Decency of falling foul upon this <i>Order</i>? What Propriety
  is there in Misrepresentation? In confounding Respects, disguising Features, and painting Things
  out of all Colour and Complexion? This crossing upon Nature and Reason, is great Ignorance, and
  out of Rule. And now what Pleasure is there in Misbehaviour and Abuse? Is it such an Entertainment
  to see Religion worryed by Atheism, and Things the most Solemn and Significant tumbled and tost by
  Buffoons? A Man may laugh at a Puppy's tearing a Wardrobe, but I think 'twere altogether as
  discreet to beat him off. Well! but the <i>Clergy</i> mismanage sometimes, and they must be told
  of their Faults. What then? Are the <i>Poets</i> their <i>Ordinaries</i>? Is the <i>Pulpit</i>
  under the <span class="pagenum" id="page139">{139}</span>Discipline of the <i>Stage</i>? And are
  those fit to correct the Church, that are not fit to come into it? Besides, What makes them fly
  out upon the <i>Function</i>; and rail by wholesale? Is the <i>Priesthood</i> a crime, and the
  service of God a disadvantage? I grant Persons and Things are not always suited. A good
  <i>Post</i> may be ill kept, but then the Censure should keep close to the Fault, and the Office
  not suffer for the Manager. The <i>Clergy</i> may have their Failings sometimes like others, but
  what then? The <i>Character</i> is still untarnish'd. The <i>Men</i> may be Little, but the
  <i>Priests</i> are not so. And therefore like other People, they ought to be treated by their best
  Distinction.</p>

  <p>If 'tis Objected that the <i>Clergy</i> in <i>Plays</i> are commonly <i>Chaplains</i>, And that
  these <i>Belonging</i> to Persons of Quality they were obliged to represent them servile and
  submissive. To this I Answer</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> In my former remark, that the <i>Stage</i> often outrages the whole <i>Order</i>,
  without regard to any particular Office. But were it not so in the</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>2d.</i> Place, They quite overlook the Character, and mistake the Business of
  <i>Chaplains</i>. They are no <i>Servants</i>, neither do they <i>Belong</i> to any <i>Body</i>,
  but God Almighty. This Point I have fully proved in another, <i>Treatise</i>,<span

  End of the Play.</i></h2>

  <p>The Lines of Virtue and Vice are Struck out by Nature in very Legible Distinctions; They tend
  to a different Point, and in the greater Instances the Space between them is easily perceiv'd.
  Nothing can be more unlike than the Original Forms of these Qualities: The First has all the
  sweetness, Charms, and Graces imaginable; The other has the Air of a <i>Post</i> ill Carved into a
  <i>Monster</i>, and looks both foolish and Frightful together. These are the Native Appearances of
  good and Evil: And they that endeavour to blot the Distinctions, to rub out the Colours, or change
  the Marks, are extreamly to blame. 'Tis confessed as long as the Mind is awake, and Conscience
  goes true, there's no fear of being imposed on. But when Vice is varnish'd over with Pleasure, and
  comes in the Shape of Convenience, the case grows somewhat dangerous; for then <span
  class="pagenum" id="page141">{141}</span>the Fancy may be gain'd, and the Guards corrupted, and
  Reason suborn'd against it self. And thus a <i>Disguise</i> often passes when the Person would
  otherwise be stopt. To put <i>Lewdness</i> into a Thriving condition, to give it an Equipage of
  Quality, and to treat it with Ceremony and Respect, is the way to confound the Understanding, to
  fortifie the Charm, and to make the Mischief invincible. Innocence is often owing to Fear, and
  Appetite is kept under by Shame; But when these Restraints are once taken off, when Profit and
  Liberty lie on the same side, and a Man can Debauch himself into Credit, what can be expected in
  such a case, but that Pleasure should grow Absolute, and Madness carry all before it? The
  <i>Stage</i> seem eager to bring Matters to this Issue; They have made a considerable progress,
  and are still pushing their Point with all the Vigour imaginable. If this be not their Aim why is
  <i>Lewdness</i> so much consider'd in Character and Success? Why are their Favourites Atheistical,
  and their fine Gentleman debauched? To what purpose is <i>Vice</i> thus prefer'd, thus ornamented,
  and caress'd, unless for Imitation? That matter of Fact stands thus, I shall make good by several
  Instances: To begin then with their Men of Breeding and <span class="pagenum"

  sinks it to the lowest ebb of Infamy. 'Tis a Corrupted Soil, Ill Nature, Avarice, Sloth,

  same Staunchness, but this the <i>Reader</i> may have in another Place.</p>

  <p>To sum up the Evidence. A fine Gentleman, is a fine Whoring, Swearing, Smutty, Atheistical Man.
  These Qualifications it seems compleat the <i>Idea</i> of Honour. They are the Top-Improvements of
  Fortune, and the distinguishing Glories of Birth and Breeding! This is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page144">{144}</span>the <i>Stage-Test</i> for <i>Quality</i>, and those that can't stand it,
  ought to be <i>Disclaim'd</i>. The Restraints of Conscience and the Pedantry of Virtue, are
  unbecoming a Cavalier: Future Securities, and Reaching beyond Life, are vulgar Provisions: If he
  falls a Thinking at this rate, he forfeits his Honour; For his Head was only made to run against a
  Post! Here you have a Man of Breeding and Figure that burlesques the <i>Bible</i>, Swears, and
  talks Smut to Ladies, speaks ill of his Friend behind his Back, and betraies his Interest. A fine
  Gentleman that has neither Honesty, nor Honour, Conscience, nor Manners, Good Nature, nor civil
  Hypocricy. Fine, only in the Insignificancy of Life, the Abuse of Religion and the Scandals of
  Conversation. These Worshipful Things are the <i>Poets</i> Favourites: They appear at the Head of
  the <i>Fashion</i>; and shine in Character, and Equipage. If there is any Sense stirring, They
  must have it, tho' the rest of the <i>Stage</i> suffer never so much by the Partiality. And what
  can be the Meaning of this wretched Distribution of Honour? Is it not to give Credit and
  Countenance to Vice, and to shame young People out of all pretences to Conscience, and Regularity?
  They seem forc'd to turn Lewd in their own Defence: They can't <span class="pagenum"
  id="page145">{145}</span>otherwise justifie themselves to the Fashion, nor keep up the Character
  of Gentlemen: Thus People not well furnish'd with Thought, and Experience, are debauch'd both in
  Practise and Principle. And thus Religion grows uncreditable, and passes for ill Education. The
  <i>Stage</i> seldom gives Quarter to any Thing that's serviceable or Significant, but persecutes
  Worth, and Goodness under every Appearance. He that would be safe from their Satir must take care
  to disguise himself in Vice, and hang out the <i>Colours</i> of Debauchery. How often is Learning,
  Industry, and Frugality, ridiculed in Comedy? The rich Citizens are often Misers, and Cuckolds,
  and the <i>Universities</i>, Schools of Pedantry upon this score. In short, Libertinism and
  Profaness, Dressing, Idleness, and Gallantry, are the only valuable Qualities. As if People were
  not apt enough of themselves to be Lazy, Lewd, and Extravagant, unless they were prick'd forward,
  and provok'd by Glory, and Reputation. Thus the Marks of Honour, and Infamy are misapplyed, and
  the Idea's of Virtue and Vice confounded. Thus Monstrousness goes for Proportion, and the
  Blemishes of Human Nature, make up the Beauties of it.</p>

  <p>And was Licentiousness and irreligion, alwaies a mark of Honour? No; I don't perceive but that
  the old <i>Poets</i> had an other Notion of Accomplishment, and bred their people of Condition a
  different way. <i>Philolaches</i> in <i>Plautus</i> laments his being debauch'd; and dilates upon

  <span class="pagenum" id="page148">{148}</span>and Modern Poets somewhat farther. But this may
  suffice.</p>

  <p>Thus we see what a fine time Lewd People have on the <i>English Stage</i>. No Censure, no mark
  of Infamy, no Mortification must touch them. They keep their Honour untarnish'd, and carry off the
  Advantage of their Character. They are set up for the Standard of Behaviour, and the Masters of
  Ceremony and Sense. And at last that the Example may work the better, they generally make them
  rich, and happy, and reward them with their own Desires.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Dryden</i> in the <i>Preface</i> to his <i>Mock-Astrologer</i>, confesses himself blamed
  for this Practise. <i>For making debauch'd Persons his</i> Protagonists, <i>or chief Persons of
  the Drama; And, for making them happy in the Conclusion of the Play, against the Law of Comedy,
  which is to reward Virtue, and punish Vice</i>. To this Objection He makes a lame Defence. And
  answers</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> <i>That he knows no such Law constantly observ'd in Comedy by the Antient or Modern
  Poets.</i> What then? <i>Poets</i> are not always exactly in Rule. It may be a good Law tho' 'tis
  not constantly observ'd, some Laws are constantly broken, and yet ne're the worse for all that. He
  goes on, and pleads the Authorities of <i>Plautus</i>, and <i>Terence</i>. I grant there are
  Instances of <span class="pagenum" id="page149">{149}</span>Favour to vitious young People in
  those Authors, but to this I reply</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> That those <i>Poets</i> had a greater compass of Liberty in their Religion.
  Debauchery did not lie under those Discouragements of Scandal, and penalty, with them as it does
  with us. Unless therefore He can prove <i>Heathenism</i>, and <i>Christianity</i> the same, his
  <i>precedents</i> will do him little service.</p>

  <p><i>2ly.</i> <i>Horace</i> who was as good a judge of the <i>Stage</i>, as either of those
  <i>Comedians</i>, seems to be of another Opinion. He condemns the obscenities of <i>Plautus</i>,
  and tells you Men of Fortune and Quality in his time; would not endure immodest Satir.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>De Art. Poet.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref310"><a
  href="#side310">[310]</a></sup> He continues, that Poets were formerly admired for the great
  services they did. For teaching Matters relating to Religion, and Government; For refining the
  Manners, tempering the Passions, and improving the Understandings of Mankind: For making them more
  useful in Domestick Relations, and the publick Capacities of Life.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref311"><a
  href="#side311">[311]</a></sup> This is a demonstration that Vice was not the Inclination of the
  Muses in those days; and that <i>Horace</i> beleiv'd the chief business of a <i>Poem</i> was, to
  Instruct the Audience. He adds farther that the <i>Chorus</i> ought to turn upon the Argument of
  the <i>Drama</i>, and support the Design of the <i>Acts</i>. That <span class="pagenum"
  id="page150">{150}</span>They ought to speak in Defence of Virtue, and Frugality, and show a
  Regard to Religion. Now from the Rule of the <i>Chorus</i>, we may conclude his Judgment for the
  <i>Play</i>. For as he observes, there must be a Uniformity between the <i>Chorus</i> and the
  <i>Acts</i>: They must have the same View, and be all of a Piece. From hence 'tis plain that
  <i>Horace</i> would have no immoral <i>Character</i> have either Countenance or good Fortune, upon
  the <i>Stage</i>. If 'tis said the very mention of the <i>Chorus</i> shews the Directions were
  intended for <i>Tragedy</i>. To this</p>

  <p>I answer, that the Consequence is not good. For the use of a <i>Chorus</i> is not inconsistent
  with <i>Comedy</i>. The antient <i>Comedians</i> had it. <i>Aristophanes</i> is an Instance. I
  know 'tis said the <i>Chorus</i> was left out in that they call the <i>New Comedy</i>. But I can't
  see the conclusiveness of this Assertion. For <i>Aristophanes</i> his <i>Plutus</i> is <i>New
  Comedy</i> with a <i>Chorus</i> in't.<span class="leftmar"><i>[......] Schol.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref312"><a href="#side312">[312]</a></sup> And <i>Aristotle</i> who lived
  after this Revolution of the <i>Stage</i>, mentions nothing of the Omission of the <i>Chorus</i>.
  He rather supposes its continuance by saying the <i>Chorus was added by the Government long after
  the Invention of Comedy</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Libr. de Poet. cap. 5.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref313"><a href="#side313">[313]</a></sup> 'Tis true <i>Plautus</i> and
  <i>Terence</i> have none, but those before them probably might. <i>Moliere</i> has now reviv'd
  them,<span class="leftmar"><i>Psyche.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref314"><a
  href="#side314">[314]</a></sup> <span class="pagenum" id="page151">{151}</span>And <i>Horace</i>
  might be of his Opinion, for ought wee know to the contrary.</p>

  <p><i>Lastly.</i> <i>Horace</i> having expresly mentioned the beginning and progress of
  <i>Comedy</i>, discovers himself more fully: He advises a <i>Poet</i> to form his Work upon the
  Precepts of <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Plato</i>, and the Models of Moral Philosophy. This was the way
  to preserve Decency, and to assign a proper Fate and Behaviour to every <i>Character</i>.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref315"><a
  href="#side315">[315]</a></sup> Now if <i>Horace</i> would have his <i>Poet</i> govern'd by the
  Maxims of Morality, he must oblige him to Sobriety of Conduct, and a just distribution of Rewards,
  and Punishments.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Dryden</i> makes Homewards, and endeavours to fortifie himself in Modern Authority. He
  lets us know that <i>Ben Johnson after whom he may he proud to Err, gives him more than one
  example of this Conduct</i>;<span class="leftmar"><i>Pref. Mock. Astrol.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref316"><a href="#side316">[316]</a></sup> <i>That in the</i> Alchemist <i>is
  notorius</i>, where neither <i>Face</i> nor his <i>Master</i> are corrected according to their
  Demerits. But how Proud soever Mr. <i>Dryden</i> may be of an Errour, he has not so much of <i>Ben
  Jonson</i>'s company as he pretends. His Instance of <i>Face &amp;c.</i> in the <i>Alchemist</i>
  is rather <i>notorious</i> against his Purpose then for it.</p>

  <p>For <i>Face</i> did not Council his Master <i>Lovewit</i> to debauch the Widdow; neither <span
  class="pagenum" id="page152">{152}</span>is it clear that the Matter went thus far. He might gain
  her consent upon Terms of Honour for ought appears to the contrary. 'Tis true <i>Face</i> who was
  one of the Principal Cheats is Pardon'd and consider'd. But then his Master confesses himself kind
  to a fault. He owns this Indulgence was a Breach of Justice, and unbecoming the Gravity of an old
  Man. And then desires the Audience to excuse him upon the Score of the Temptation. But <i>Face
  continued, in the Cousenage till the last without Repentance</i>.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref317"><a
  href="#side317">[317]</a></sup> Under favour I conceive this is a Mistake. For does not
  <i>Face</i> make an Apology before he leaves the <i>Stage</i>? Does he not set himself at the
  <i>Bar</i>, arraign his own Practise, and cast the Cause upon the Clemency of the Company? And are
  not all these Signs of the Dislike of what he had done? Thus careful the <i>Poet</i> is to prevent
  the Ill Impressions of his <i>Play</i>! He brings both Man and Master to Confession. He dismisses
  them like Malefactours; And moves for their Pardon before he gives them their Discharge. But the
  <i>Mock-Astrologer</i> has a gentler Hand: <i>Wild-Blood</i> and <i>Jacinta</i> are more
  generously used: There is no Acknowledgment exacted; no Hardship put upon them: They are permitted
  to talk on in their Libertine way to <span class="pagenum" id="page153">{153}</span>the Last: And
  take Leave without the least Appearance of Reformation. The <i>Mock-Astrologer</i> urges <i>Ben
  Johnson's</i> <i>Silent Woman</i> as an other <i>Precedent</i> to his purpose. For <i>there</i>
  Dauphine <i>confesses himself in Love with all the Collegiate Lady's</i>. <i>And yet this
  naughty</i> Dauphine <i>is Crowned in the end with the Possession of his Uncles Estate, and with
  the hopes of all his Mistresses</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref318"><a href="#side318">[318]</a></sup> This Charge, as I take it, is somewhat too severe.
  I grant <i>Dauphine</i> Professes himself in Love with the Collegiate Ladies at first. But when
  they invited him to a private Visit, he makes them no Promise; but rather appears tired, and
  willing to disengage. <i>Dauphine</i> therefore is not altogether so naughty as this Author
  represents him.</p>

  <p><i>Ben Johnson's</i> <i>Fox</i> is clearly against Mr. <i>Dryden</i>. And here I have his own
  Confession for proof. He declares the <i>Poets end in this Play was the Punishment of Vice, and
  the Reward of Virtue</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Essay of Dramatick Poetry. p. 28.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref319"><a href="#side319">[319]</a></sup> <i>Ben</i> was forced to strain
  for this piece of Justice, and break through the <i>Unity of Design</i>. This Mr. <i>Dryden</i>
  remarks upon him: How ever he is pleased to commend the Performance, and calls it an excellent
  <i>Fifth Act</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ben Johnson</i> shall speak for himself afterwards in the Character of a Critick; <span
  class="pagenum" id="page154">{154}</span>In the mean time I shall take a Testimony or two from
  <i>Shakespear</i>. And here we may observe the admir'd <i>Falstaffe</i> goes off in
  Disappointment. He is thrown out of Favour as being a <i>Rake</i>, and dies like a Rat behind the
  Hangings. The Pleasure he had given, would not excuse him. The <i>Poet</i> was not so partial, as
  to let his Humour compound for his Lewdness. If 'tis objected that this remark is wide of the
  Point, because <i>Falstaffe</i> is represented in Tragedy, where the Laws of Justice are more
  strickly observ'd, To this I answer, that you may call <i>Henry</i> the Fourth and Fifth,
  Tragedies if you please. But for all that, <i>Falstaffe</i> wears no <i>Buskins</i>, his Character
  is perfectly Comical from end to end.</p>

  <p>The next Instance shall be in <i>Flowerdale</i> the <i>Prodigal</i>. This Spark notwithstanding
  his Extravagance, makes a lucky Hand on't at last, and <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'marries up', corrected
  by Errata">marries</span> a rich Lady.<span class="leftmar"><i>The London
  Prodigall.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref320"><a href="#side320">[320]</a></sup> But then
  the Poet qualifies him for his good Fortune, and mends his Manners with his Circumstances. He
  makes him repent, and leave off his Intemperance, Swearing <i>&amp;c.</i> And when his Father
  warn'd him against a Relapse, He answers very soberly,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>Heaven helping me I'le hate the Course of Hell.</i></p>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page155">{155}</span></div>

  <p>I could give some instances of this kind out of <i>Beaumount</i> and <i>Fletcher</i>, But
  there's no need of any farther Quotation; For Mr. <i>Dryden</i> is not satisfied with his Apology
  from Authority: He does as good as own that this may be construed no better than defending one ill
  practise by another. To prevent this very reasonable objection he endeavours to vindicate his
  <i>Precedents</i> from the Reason of the Thing. To this purpose he <i>makes a wide difference
  between the Rules of Tragedy and Comedy. That Vice must be impartially prosecuted in the first,
  because the Persons are Great &amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>It seems then <i>Executions</i> are only for <i>Greatness</i>; and <i>Quality</i>.
  <i>Justice</i> is not to strike much <i>lower</i> than a <i>Prince</i>. <i>Private People</i> may
  do what they <i>please</i>. They are too <i>few</i> for <i>Mischief</i>, and too <i>Little</i> for
  <i>Punishment</i>! This would be admirable Doctrine for <i>Newgate</i>, and give us a general
  <i>Goal-Delivery</i> without more ado. But in <i>Tragedy</i> (says the <i>Mock Astrologer</i>.)
  <i>the Crimes are likewise Horrid</i>, so that there is a necessity for Severity and Example. And
  how stands the matter in <i>Comedy</i>? Quite otherwise. There the <i>Faults are but the follies
  of Youth, and the Frailties of Human Nature</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref321"><a href="#side321">[321]</a></sup> For Instance. There is nothing but
  a little Whoring, Pimping, Gaming, Profaness <i>&amp;c</i>, And who could be so hard hearted <span
  class="pagenum" id="page156">{156}</span>to give a Man any Trouble for This? Such Rigours would be
  strangely Inhumane! A <i>Poet</i> is a better natur'd Thing I can assure you. These little
  Miscarrages <i>move Pity and Commiseration, and are not such as must of necessity be
  Punish'd</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref322"><a
  href="#side322">[322]</a></sup> This is comfortable Casuistry! But to be Serious. Is Dissolution
  of Manners such a Peccadillo? Does a Profligate Conscience deserve nothing but Commiseration? And
  are People damn'd only for <i>Humane Frailties</i>? I perceive the Laws of Religion and those of
  the <i>Stage</i> differ extreamly! The strength of his Defence lies in this choice Maxim, that the
  <i>Cheif End of Comedy is Delight</i>. He questions <i>whether Instruction has any thing to do in
  Comedy</i>; If it has, he is sure <i>'tis no more then its secondary end</i>: <i>For the business
  of the Poet is to make you laugh</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref323"><a href="#side323">[323]</a></sup> Granting the Truth of this
  Principle, I somewhat question the serviceableness of it. For is there no Diversion to be had
  unless Vice appears prosperous, and rides at the Head of Success. One would think such a
  preposterous, distribution of Rewards, should rather shock the Reason, and raise the Indignation
  of the <i>Audience</i>. To laugh without reason is the Pleasure of Fools, and against it, of
  something worse. The exposing of Knavery, and making <i>Lewdness</i> ridiculous, is a much better
  occasion for Laughter. <span class="pagenum" id="page157">{157}</span>And this with submission I
  take to be the End of <i>Comedy</i>. And therefore it does not differ from <i>Tragedy</i> in the
  End, but in the <i>Means</i>. Instruction is the principal Design of both. The one works by
  Terror, the other by Infamy. 'Tis true, they don't move in the same Line, but they meet in the
  same point at last. For this Opinion I have good Authority, besides what has been cited
  already.</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> Monsieur <i>Rapin</i> affirms 'That Delight is the End that Poetry aims at, but not
  the Principal one. For Poetry being an Art, ought to be profitable by the quality of it's own
  nature, and by the Essential Subordination that all Arts should have to Polity, whose End in
  General is the publick Good. This is the Judgment of <i>Aristotle</i> and of <i>Horace</i> his
  chief Interpreter.<span class="leftmar"><i>Rapin Reflect. &amp;c. p. 10.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref324"><a href="#side324">[324]</a></sup> <i>Ben Johnson</i> in his
  Dedicatory Epistle of his <i>Fox</i> has somewhat considerable upon this Argument; And declaims
  with a great deal of zeal, spirit, and good Sense, against the Licentiousness of the <i>Stage</i>.
  He lays it down for a Principle, 'That 'tis impossible to be a good <i>Poet</i> without being a
  good <i>Man</i>. That he (a good Poet) is said to be able to inform Young Men to all good
  Discipline, and enflame grown Men to all great Virtues &amp;c.&mdash;That the general complaint
  was that the <i>Writers</i> of those days had <span class="pagenum"
  id="page158">{158}</span>nothing remaining in them of the Dignity of a <i>Poet</i>, but the abused
  Name. That now, especially in Stage Poetry, nothing but Ribaldry, Profanation, <i>Blasphemy</i>,
  all Licence of Offence to God and Man, is practised. He confesses a great part of this Charge is
  over-true, and is sorry he dares not deny it. But then he hopes all are not embark'd in this bold
  Adventure for Hell. For my part (says he) I can, and from a most clear Conscience affirm; That I
  have ever trembled to think towards the least Profaness, and loath'd the Use of such foul, and
  unwash'd Bawdry, as is now made the Food of the <i>Scene</i>.&mdash;The encrease of which Lust in
  Liberty, what Learned or Liberal Soul does not abhor? In whole <i>Enterludes</i> nothing but the
  Filth of the Time is utter'd&mdash;with Brothelry able to violate the Ear of a <i>Pagan</i>, and
  Blasphemy, to turn the Blood of a Christian to Water. He continues, that the Insolence of these
  Men had brought the <i>Muses</i> into Disgrace, and made <i>Poetry</i> the lowest scorn of the
  Age. He appeals to his Patrons the <i>Universities</i>, that his Labour has been heretofore, and
  mostly in this his latest Work, to reduce not only the antient Forms, but Manners of the
  <i>Scene</i>, the Innocence and the Doctrine, which is the <b>Principal End</b> of Poesy, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page159">{159}</span>to inform Men in the best Reason of Living.' Lastly he
  adds, that 'he has imitated the Conduct of the Antients in this <i>Play</i>, The goings out (or
  Conclusions) of whose <i>Comedies</i>, were not always joyful but oft-times the Bawds, the Slaves,
  the Rivals, ye and the Masters are multed, and fitly, it being the Office of a <i>Comick Poet</i>
  (mark that!) to imitate Justice, and Instruct to Life <i>&amp;c.</i>' Say you so! Why then if
  <i>Ben Johnson</i> knew any thing of the Matter, Divertisment and Laughing is not as Mr.
  <i>Dryden</i> affirms, the <i>Chief End</i> of <i>Comedy</i>. This Testimony is so very full and
  clear, that it needs no explaining, nor any enforcement from Reasoning, and Consequence.</p>

  <p>And because Laughing and Pleasure has such an unlimited Prerogative upon the <i>Stage</i>, I
  shall add a Citation or two from <i>Aristotle</i> concerning this Matter. Now this great Man
  'calls those Buffoons, and Impertinents, who rally without any regard to Persons or Things, to
  Decency, or good Manners. That there is a great difference between Ribaldry, and handsom Rallying.
  He that would perform exactly, must keep within the Character of Virtue, and Breeding. He goes on,
  and tells us that the old Comedians entertain'd the Audience with Smut, but the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page160">{160}</span>Modern ones avoided that Liberty, and grew more reserv'd.
  This latter way he says was much more proper and Gentile then the other. That in his Opinion
  Rallying, no less than Railing, ought to be under the Discipline of Law; That he who is ridden by
  his <i>Jests</i>, and minds nothing but the business of <i>Laughing</i>, is himself Ridiculous.
  And that a Man of Education and Sense, is so far from going these Lengths that he wont so much as
  endure the hearing some sort of Buffoonry.'<span class="leftmar"><i>Libr. 4. de Morib. cap.
  14.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref325"><a href="#side325">[325]</a></sup></p>

  <p>And as to the point of Delight in general, the same Author affirms, 'that scandalous
  Satisfactions are not properly Pleasures. 'Tis only Distemper, and false Appetite which makes them
  palatable. And a Man that is sick, seldom has his Tast true. Besides, supposing we throw Capacity
  out of the Question, and make Experiment and Sensation the Judge; Granting this, we ought not to
  chop at every Bait, nor Fly out at every Thing that strikes the Fancy. The meer Agreableness must
  not overbear us, without distinguishing upon the Quality, and the Means. Pleasure how charming
  soever, must not be fetched out of Vice. An Estate is a pretty thing, but if we purchase by
  Falshood, and Knavery, <span class="pagenum" id="page161">{161}</span>we pay too much for't. Some
  Pleasures, are Childish and others abominable; And upon the whole, Pleasure, absolutely speaking,
  is no good Thing.'<span class="leftmar"><i>De Mor. Lib. 10, cap. 2.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref326"><a href="#side326">[326]</a></sup> And so much for the Philosopher.
  And because <i>Ribaldry</i> is used for Sport, a passage or two from <i>Quintilian</i>, may not be
  unseasonable. This Orator does not only Condemn the grosser Instances, but cuts off all the
  <i>Double-Entendre's</i> at a Blow. He comes up to the Regularity of Thought, and tells us 'that
  the Meaning, as well as the Words of Discourse must be unsullied.'<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Institut. Lib. 6; c. 3.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref327"><a
  href="#side327">[327]</a></sup> And in the same <i>Chapter</i> he adds that 'A Man of Probity has
  always a Reserve in his Freedoms, and Converses within the Rules of Modesty, and Character. And
  that Mirth at the expence of Virtue, is an Over-purchase,' <i>Nimium enim risus pretium est si
  probitatis impendio constat</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus we see how these great <i>Masters</i> qualify Diversion, and tie it up to
  <i>Provisoes,</i> and Conditions. Indeed to make <i>Delight</i> the main business of <i>Comedy</i>
  is an unreasonable and dangerous Principle. It opens the way to all Licentiousness, and Confounds
  the distinction between Mirth, and Madness. For if Diversion is the <i>Chief End</i>, it must be
  had at any Price, No serviceable Expedient must be refused, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page162">{162}</span>tho' never so scandalous. And thus the worst Things are said, and best
  abus'd; Religion is insulted, and the most serious Matters turn'd into Ridicule! As if the
  Blindside of an Audience ought to be caress'd, and their Folly and Atheism entertain'd in the
  first Place. Yes, if the Palate is pleas'd, no matter tho' the Body is Poyson'd! For can one die
  of an easier Disease than Diversion? But Raillery apart, certainly Mirth and Laughing, without
  respect to the Cause, are not such supreme Satisfactions! A man has sometimes Pleasure in losing
  his Wits. Frensy, and <i>Possession</i>, will shake the Lungs, and brighten the Face; and yet I
  suppose they are not much to be coveted. However, now we know the Reason of the Profaness, and
  Obscenity of the <i>Stage</i>, of their Hellish Cursing, and Swearing, and in short of their great
  Industry to make God, and Goodness Contemptible: 'Tis all to Satisfie the Company, and make People
  Laugh! A most admirable justification! What can be more engaging to an <i>Audience</i>, then to
  see a <i>Poet</i> thus Atheistically brave? To see him charge up to the Canons Mouth, and defy the
  Vengeance of Heaven to serve them? Besides, there may be somewhat of Convenience in the Case. To
  fetch Diversion out of <span class="pagenum" id="page163">{163}</span>Innocence is no such easy
  matter. There's no succeeding it may be in this method, without Sweat, and Drudging. Clean Wit,
  inoffensive Humour, and handsom Contrivance, require Time, and Thought. And who would be at this
  Expence, when the Purchase is so cheap another way? 'Tis possible a <i>Poet</i> may not alwaies
  have Sense enough by him for such an Occasion. And since we are upon supposals, it may be the
  <i>Audience</i> is not to be gain'd without straining a Point, and giving a Loose to Conscience:
  And when People are sick, are they not to be Humour'd? In sine, We must make them Laugh, right or
  wrong, for <i>Delight</i> is the <i>Cheif End of Comedy</i>. <i>Delight!</i> He should have said
  <i>Debauchery</i>: That's the English of the Word, and the Consequence of the Practise. But the
  Original Design of <i>Comedy</i> was otherwise: And granting 'twas not so, what then? If the
  <i>Ends</i> of Thing are naught, they must be mended. Mischief is the Chief end of Malice, would
  it be then a Blemish in Ill Nature to change Temper, and relent into Goodness? The Chief
  <i>End</i> of a Madman it may be is to Fire a House, must we not <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'then', corrected by
  Errata">therefore</span> bind him in his Bed? To conclude. If <i>Delight</i> without Restraint, or
  Distinction without Conscience or Shame, is the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page164">{164}</span>Supream Law of <i>Comedy</i>, 'twere well if we had less on't. Arbitrary
  Pleasure, is more dangerous than Arbitrary Power. Nothing is more Brutal than to be abandon'd to
  Appetite; And nothing more wretched than to serve in such a Design. The <i>Mock-Astrologer</i> to
  clear himself of this Imputation, is glad to give up his Principle at Last. <i>Least any Man
  should think</i> (says He) <i>that I write this to make Libertinism amiable, or that I cared not
  to debase the end, and Institution of</i> Comedy. (It seems then <i>Delight</i> is not the Chief
  end.) <i>I must farther declare that we make not Vitious Persons Happy, but only as Heaven makes
  Sinners so.</i> &amp;c. If this will hold, all's well. But <i>Heaven</i> does not forgive without
  Repentance. Let us see then what Satisfaction he requires from his <i>Wild-Blood</i>, and what
  Discipline he puts him under. Why, He helps him to his Mistress, he Marries him to a Lady of Birth
  and Fortune. And now do you think He has not made him an Example, and punish'd him to some
  Purpose! These are frightful Severities! Who would be vitious when such Terrors hang over his
  Head? And does <i>Heaven make Sinners happy</i> upon these Conditions? Sure some People have a
  good Opinion of Vice, or a very ill one of Marriage, otherwise they <span class="pagenum"
  id="page165">{165}</span>would have Charged the Penance a little more. But I have nothing farther
  with the <i>Mock-Astrologer</i>.</p>

  <p>And now for the Conclusion of a <i>Chapter</i>, I shall give some Instances of the
  <i>Manners</i> of the <i>Stage</i>, and that with respect to Poetry, and Ceremony. <i>Manners</i>
  in the Language of Poetry, is a Propriety of Actions, and Persons. To succeed in this business,
  there must always be a regard had to Age, Sex, and Condition: And nothing put into the Mouths of
  Persons which disagrees with any of these Circumstances. 'Tis not enough to say a witty Thing,
  unless it be spoken by a likely Person, and upon a Proper occasion. But my Design will lead me to
  this Subject afterwards, and therefore I shall say no more of it at present, but proceed to apply
  the Remark.</p>

  <p>One Instance of Impropriety in <i>Manners</i> both Poetical and Moral, is their making Women,
  and Women of Quality talk Smuttily. This I have proved upon them already, and could cite many more
  places to the same Purpose were it necessary.</p>

  <p>But I shall go on, and give the <i>Reader</i> some other examples of Decency, Judgment, and
  Probability. <i>Don Sebastian</i> will help us in some measure. Here <span class="pagenum"
  id="page166">{166}</span>the <i>Mufti</i> makes a foolish Speech to the Rabble, and jests upon his
  own Religion. He tells them, <i>tho' your Tyrant is a Lawful Emperour, yet your Lawful Emperour is
  but a Tyrant,&mdash;&mdash;That your Emperour is a Tyrant is most Manifest, for you were born to
  be Turks, but he has play'd the Turk with you.</i> And now is not this Man fit to Manage the
  <i>Alcoran</i>, and to be set up for on Oracle of State? <i>Captain Tom</i> should have had this
  Speech by right: But the <i>Poet</i> had a farther Design, and any thing is good enough for a
  <i>Mufti</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sebastian</i> after all the violence of his Repentance, his grasping at self Murther, and
  Resolutions for the <i>Cell</i>, is strangely pleased with the Remembrance of his <i>Incest</i>,
  and wishes the Repetition of it: And <i>Almeida</i> out of her Princely Modesty, and singular
  Compunction, is of the same mind. This is somewhat surprising! <i>Oedipus</i> and <i>Jocasta</i>
  in <i>Sophocles</i> don't Repent at this rate. No: The horror of the first Discovery continues
  upon their Spirits: They never relapse into any fits of Intemperance, nor entertain themselves
  with a lewd Memory. This sort of Behaviour is not only more Instructive but more Natural too. It
  being very unlikely one should wish the Repeating a Crime, when He was almost Distracted <span
  class="pagenum" id="page167">{167}</span>at the thoughts on't, At the thoughts on't, tho' 'twas
  comitted under all the Circumstances of excuse. Now when Ignorance and meer Mistake are so very
  disquieting, 'tis very strange if a Man should plague his Mind with the Aggravations of Knowledge;
  To carry Aversion, and Desire, in their full strength upon the same Object; To fly and pursue with
  so much eagerness, is somewhat Unusual.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 32.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref328"><a href="#side328">[328]</a></sup></p>

  <p>If we step to the <i>Spanish Fryar</i> He will afford us a Flight worth the observing. 'Tis
  part of the Addresses of <i>Torrismond</i> to <i>Leonora</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>You are so Beautiful</i></p>
    <p><i>So wondrous Fair, you justifie Rebellion;</i></p>
    <p><i>As if that faultless Face could make no Sin,</i></p>
    <p><i>But Heaven by looking on it must forgive.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>These are strange Compliments! <i>Torrismond</i> calls his Queen Rebel to her head, when he was
  both her General and her Lover. This is powerful Rhetorick to Court a Queen with! Enough one would
  think to have made the Affair desperate. But he has a Remedy at hand. The <i>Poets Nostrum</i> of
  Profaness cures all. He does as good as tell Her, she may Sin as much as she has a mind to. Her
  Face is a Protection to her Conscience. For <span class="pagenum" id="page168">{168}</span>Heaven
  is under a necessity to forgive a Handsom Woman. To say all this ought to be pass'd over in
  <i>Torrismond</i> on the score of his Passion, is to make the Excuse more scandalous than the
  Fault, if possible. Such Raptures are fit only for <i>Bedlam</i>, or a place which I shan't name.
  <i>Love Triumphant</i> will furnish another Rant not altogether inconsiderable. Here
  <i>Celadea</i> a Maiden Lady when she was afraid her Spark would be married to another, calls out
  presently for a <i>Chaos</i>. She is for pulling the World about her ears, tumbling all the
  Elements together, and expostulates with Heaven for making Humane Nature otherwise than it should
  have been.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>Great Nature break thy chain that links together</i></p>

  <p>Now to my fancy, if she had call'd for a <i>Chair</i> instead of a <i>Chaos</i>, trip'd off,
  and kept her folly to her self, the Woman had been much wiser. And since we have shown our Skill
  in vaulting on the High Ropes, a little <i>Tumbling</i> on the <i>Stage</i>, may not do amiss for
  variety.</p>

  <p>Now then for a jest or two. <i>Don Gomez</i> shall begin:<span class="leftmar"><i>Spanish

  here he'le give us <span class="pagenum" id="page169">{169}</span>a Gingle upon the double meaning

  <p>These <i>Spaniards</i> will entertain us with more of this fine Raillery. Colonel <i>Sancho</i>
  in <i>Love Triumphant</i> has a great stroak at it. He says his Bride <i>Dalinda</i> is no more
  <i>Dalinda</i>, but <i>Dalilah</i> the <i>Philistine</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>p.

  of the Guards,<sup class="handonly" id="ref334"><a href="#side334">[334]</a></sup> is much about
  as witty as <i>Sancho</i>. It seems <i>Emmeline</i> Heiress to the Duke of <i>Cornwal</i> was
  Blind. <i>Albanact</i> takes the rise of his Thought from hence; And observes <i>that as Blind as
  she is, Coswald would have no blind Bargain of her</i>. <i>Carlos</i> tells <i>Sancho</i> he is

  <i>has no more to do but to take out a License</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sancho</i> replies, <i>Indeed I have her License for it</i>. <i>Carlos</i> is somewhat angry
  at this Gingle, and cries, <i>what quibling too in your Prosperity</i>? Adversity it seems is the
  only time for <i>punning</i>. Truly I think so too. For 'tis a sign a Man is much Distress'd when
  he flies to such an Expedient. However, <i>Carlos</i> needed not to have been so touchy: For He
  can stoop as low himself upon occasion. We must know then that <i>Sancho</i> had made Himself a
  Hunch'd Back, to counterfeit the <i>Conde Alonzo</i>. The two Colonels being in the same Disguise,
  were just upon the edg of a Quarrel. After some Preliminaries in Railing, <i>Sancho</i> cries,
  <i>Don't provoke me; I am mischeivously bent</i>.</p>

  <p>Carlos replies, <i>Nay, you are</i> <b>Bent</b> <i>enough in Conscience, but I have a</i>
  <b>Bent</b> Fist <i>for Boxing</i>. Here you have a brace of Quibbles started in a Line and a
  half. And which is worst of all, they come from <i>Carlos</i>, from a <i>Character</i> of Sense;
  And therefore the poet, not the <i>Soldier</i>, must answer for them.</p>

  <p>I shall now give the <i>Reader</i> a few Instances of the Courtship of the <i>Stage</i>, and
  how decently they treat the Women, and <i>Quality</i> of both <i>Sexes</i>. The <i>Women</i> who
  <span class="pagenum" id="page171">{171}</span>are secured from Affronts by Custom, and have a
  Privilege for Respect, are sometimes but roughly saluted by these Men of Address. And to bar the
  Defence, this Coarseness does not alwaies come from Clowns, and Women-haters; but from
  <i>Persons</i> of Figure, neither singular, nor ill Bred. And which is still worse, The Satir
  falls on blindly without Distinction, and strikes at the whole <i>Sex</i>.</p>

  <p>The following <i>Plays</i>, excepting the Last, will fall under the same Heads of Commendation
  with the Former. However, since the <i>Poets</i> have here been prodigal in their Expence, and
  dress'd themselves with more Curiosity then ordinary, they deserve a proportionable Regard. So
  much Finery must not be Crowded. I shall therefore make Elbow-Room for their Figure, and allow
  them the Compass of a distinct Chapter.</p>

  <p>To begin with <i>Amphytrion</i>. In this <i>Play</i> Mr. <i>Dryden</i> represents
  <i>Jupiter</i> with the Attributes of the supream Being: He furnishes him with Omnipotence, makes
  him the Creator of Nature, and the Arbiter of Fate, puts all the Functions of Providence in his
  Hand, and describes him with the Majesty of the true God.<span class="leftmar"><i>Amphit. p. 1, 2,
  3, 8, 9.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref353"><a href="#side353">[353]</a></sup> And when
  he has put Him in this glorious <span class="pagenum" id="page178">{178}</span>Equipage, he brings
  him out for Diversion. He makes him express himself in the most intemperate Raptures:<span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 8. 17.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref354"><a
  href="#side354">[354]</a></sup> He is willing to <i>Renounce</i> his <i>Heaven</i> for his
  Brutality, and employ a whole <i>Eternity</i> in Lewdness. He draws his Debauch at its full
  Length, with all the Art, and Heightings, and Foulness of Idea immaginable. This <i>Jupiter</i> is
  not contented with his success against <i>Amphitrion</i>, unless he brings <i>Alcmena</i> into the
  Confederacy, and makes her a Party <i>ex post Facto</i>. He would not have her think of her
  <i>Husband</i>, but her <i>Lover</i>, that is, her <i>Whoremaster</i>. 'Tis not the success, but
  the manner of gaining it which is all in all. 'Tis the Vice which is the charming Circumstance.
  Innocence and Regularity, are dangerous Companions; They spoil Satisfaction, and make every Thing
  insipid! Unless People take care to discharge their Virtue, and clear off their Conscience, their
  Senses will vanish immediately! For <i>Jupiter</i>, says he,<span class="leftmar"><i>p.
  18.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref355"><a href="#side355">[355]</a></sup> would <i>owe
  nothing to a Name so dull as Husband</i>. And in the next Page.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>That very name of Wife And Marriage</i></p>
    <p><i>Is poyson to the dearest sweets of Love.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>19.</i></span><sup
    class="handonly" id="ref356"><a href="#side356">[356]</a></sup></p>
  </div>

  <p>I would give the <i>Reader</i> some more of these fine Sentences, but that they are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page179">{179}</span>too much out of Order to appear. The truth is, Our
  <i>Stage-Poets</i> seem to fence against Censure by the excess of Lewdness; And to make the
  overgrown size of a Crime, a Ground for Impunity. As if a Malefactor should project his Escape by
  appearing too scandalous for Publick Tryal. However, This is their Armour of Proof, this is the
  Strength they retreat to. They are fortified in Smut, and almost impregnable in Stench, so that
  where they deserve most, there's no coming at them. To proceed. I desire to know what Authority
  Mr. <i>Dryden</i> has for this extraordinary Representation? His Original <i>Plautus</i>, is no
  President. Indeed <i>Plautus</i> is the only bold Heathen that ever made <i>Jupiter</i> tread the
  <i>Stage</i>. But then he stops far short of the Liberties of the <i>English Amphitrion.
  Jupiter</i> at <i>Rome</i>, and <i>London</i>, have the same unaccountable Design; but the Methods
  of pursuit are very different. The First, does not solicit in scandalous Language, nor flourish
  upon his Lewdness, nor endeavours to set it up for the Fashion. <i>Plautus</i> had some regard to
  the Height of the Character, and the Opinion of his Country, and the Restraints of Modesty. The
  Sallies of <i>Aristophanes</i> do not come up to the case; And if they did, I have cut off the
  Succours from that <span class="pagenum" id="page180">{180}</span>Quarter already. <i>Terence's
  Chærea</i>. is the next bold Man:<span class="leftmar"><i>Eunuch.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref357"><a href="#side357">[357]</a></sup> However, here the Fable of <i>Jupiter</i> and
  <i>Danae</i> are just glanced at, and the Expression is clean; and He that tells the Story, a
  Young Libertine. These are all circumstances of extenuation, and give quite another Complexion to
  the Thing. As for the <i>Greek Tragedians</i> and <i>Seneca</i>, there's no Prescription can be
  drawn from them. They mention <i>Jupiter</i> in Terms of Magnificence and Respect, and make his
  Actions, and his Nature of a piece. But it may be the Celebrated <i>Homer</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>
  may give Mr. <i>Dryden</i> some Countenance. Not at all. <i>Virgil's Jupiter</i> is alwaies great,
  and solemn, and keeps up the port of a Deity. 'Tis true, <i>Homer</i> does not guard the Idea with
  that exactness, but then He never sinks the Character into Obscenity. The most exceptionable
  passage is that where <i>Jupiter</i> relates his Love Adventures to <i>Juno</i>. Here this
  pretended Deity is charm'd with <i>Venus</i>'s Girdle, is in the height of his Courtship, and
  under the Ascendant of his Passion. This 'tis confess'd was a slippery Place, and yet the Poet
  makes a shift to keep his Feet. His <i>Jupiter</i> is Little, but not nauseous; The Story, tho'
  improper, will bear the telling, and look Conversation in the Face. However; These <span
  class="pagenum" id="page181">{181}</span>Freedoms of <i>Homer</i> were counted intolerable: I
  shall not insist on the Censures of <i>Justin Martyr</i>, or <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>: Even the
  Heathen could not endure them. The Poets are lashed by <i>Plato</i> upon this Score; For planting
  Vice in Heaven, and making their Gods infectious; If Mr. <i>Dryden</i> answers that <i>Jupiter</i>
  can do us no Harm.<span class="leftmar"><i>Euseb. præpar. Evang.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref358"><a href="#side358">[358]</a></sup> He is known to be an Idol of Lewd Memory, and
  therefore his Example can have no Force: Under Favour this is a mistake: For won't Pitch daub when
  a dirty Hand throws it; or can't a Toad spit Poyson because she's ugly? Ribaldry is dangerous
  under any Circumstances of Representation. And as <i>Menander</i> and St. <i>Paul</i> express it,
  <i>Evil Communications corrupt good Manners</i>. I mention them both, because if the
  <i>Apostle</i> should be dislik'd, the <i>Comedian</i> may pass. But after all, Mr. <i>Dryden</i>
  has not so much as a Heathen President for his Singularities. What then made him fall into them?
  Was it the Decency of the Thing, and the Propriety of <i>Character</i>, and Behaviour? By no
  means. For as I have observ'd before, Nature and Operations, ought to be proportion'd, and
  Behaviour suited to the Dignity of Being. To draw a Monkey in Royal Robes, and a Prince in
  <i>Antick</i>, would be Farce upon <span class="pagenum" id="page182">{182}</span>Colours,
  entertain like a Monster, and please only upon the score of Deformity. Why then does Mr.
  <i>Dryden</i> cross upon Nature and Authority, and go off as he Confesses, from the Plan of
  <i>Plautus</i>, and <i>Moliere</i>? Tho' by the way, the English <i>Amphitryon</i> has borrow'd
  most of the Libertine Thoughts of <i>Moliere</i>, and improv'd them. But to the former question.
  Why must the beaten Road be left? He tells us, <i>That the difference of our</i> Stage <i>from the
  Roman and the French did so require it</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ep. Ded.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref359"><a href="#side359">[359]</a></sup> That is, our <i>Stage</i> must be
  much more Licentious. For you are to observe that Mr. <i>Dryden</i>, and his Fraternity, have
  help'd to debauch the <i>Town</i>, and Poyson their Pleasures to an unusal Degree: And therefore
  the Diet must be dress'd to the Palate of the <i>Company</i>. And since they are made
  <i>Scepticks</i>, they must be entertain'd as such. That the English <i>Amphitryon</i> was
  contriv'd with this View is too plain to be better interpreted. To what purpose else does
  <i>Jupiter</i> appear in the shape of <i>Jehovah</i>? Why are the incommunicable <i>Attributes</i>
  burlesqu'd, and Omnipotence applyed to Acts of Infamy? To what end can such Horrible stuff as this
  serve, unless to expose the Notion, and extinguish the Belief of a Deity? The Perfections of God,
  are Himself. To <span class="pagenum" id="page183">{183}</span>ridicule his Attributes and his
  Being, are but two words for the same Thing. These Attributes are bestow'd on <i>Jupiter</i> with
  great Prodigality, and afterwards execrably outrag'd. The Case being thus, the Cover of an Idol,
  is <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'to', corrected by Errata">too</span> thin a
  pretence to Screen the Blasphemy. Nothing but Mr. <i>Dryden's Absolom</i> and <i>Achitophel</i>
  can out-do This. Here I confess the Motion of his Pen is bolder, and the Strokes more Black'd.
  Here we have Blasphemy on the top of the Letter, without any trouble of Inference, or
  Construction. This Poem runs all upon Scripture Names, Upon Suppositions of the true Religion, and
  the right Object of Worship. Here Profaness is shut out from Defence, and lies open without Colour
  or Evasion. Here are no Pagan Divinities in the Scheme, so that all the Atheistick Raillery must
  point upon the true God. In the beginning we are told that <i>Absalom</i> was <i>David's</i>
  Natural Son: So then there's a blot in his <i>Scutcheon</i> and a Blemish upon his Birth. The
  <i>Poet</i> will make admirable use of this, remark presently! This <i>Absalom</i> it seems was
  very extraordinary in his Person and Performances. Mr. <i>Dryden</i> does not certainly know how
  this came about, and therefore enquires of himself in the first place,</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page184">{184}</span></div>

  <p>This is down right Defiance of the Living God! Here you have the very Essence and Spirit of
  Blasphemy, and the Holy Ghost brought in upon the most hideous Occasion. I question whether the
  Torments and Despair of the Damn'd, dare venture at such Flights as these. They are beyond
  Description, I Pray God they may not be beyond Pardon too. I can't forbear saying, that the next
  bad Thing to the writing these Impieties, is to Suffer them. To return to <i>Amphitryon</i>.
  <i>Ph&#x0153;bus</i> and <i>Mercury</i> have <i>Manners</i> assign'd very disagreeable to their
  Condition. The later abating Propriety of Language, talks more like a <i>Water-man</i> than a
  Deity. They rail against the Gods, and call <i>Mars</i> and <i>Vulcan</i> the <i>two Fools of
  Heaven. Mercury</i> is pert upon his Father <i>Jupiter</i>, makes jests upon his Pleasures, and
  his Greatness, and is horribly smutty and profane.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 3, 16,
  etc.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref361"><a href="#side361">[361]</a></sup> And all this
  Misbehaviour comes from him in his own shape, and in the sublimity of his Character. Had He run
  Riot in the Disguise of <i>Sofia</i>, the Discourse and the Person had been better adjusted, and
  the Extravagance more Pardonable. <span class="pagenum" id="page185">{185}</span>But here the
  Decorum is quite lost. To see the <i>Immortals</i> play such Gambols, and the biggest Beings do
  the least Actions, is strangely unnatural. An Emperour in the Grimaces of an Ape, or the
  Diversions of a Kitten, would not be half so ridiculous. Now as Monsieur <i>Rapin</i> observes,
  without Decorum there can be no <i>probability</i>, nor without Probability any true Beauty.
  Nature must be minded, otherwise Things will look forced, tawdry, and chimerical. Mr.
  <i>Dryden</i> discourses very handsomly on this occasion in his <i>Preface</i> to <i>Albion</i>
  and <i>Albanius</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 1.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref362"><a
  href="#side362">[362]</a></sup> He informs us, <i>That Wit has been truly defin'd a propriety of
  Words and Thoughts.&mdash;&mdash;That Propriety of Thought is that Fancy which arises naturally
  from the Subject.</i> Why then without doubt, the Quality, of Characters should be taken care of,
  and great Persons appear like themselves. Yes, yes, all this is granted by implication, and Mr.
  <i>Dryden</i> comes still nearer to the present case. He tells us, that <i>Propriety is to be
  observed, even in Machines; And that the Gods are all to manage their Peculiar Provinces</i>. He
  instances in some of their respective Employments; but I don't find that any of them were to talk
  Lewdly. No. He plainly supposes the contrary. For as he goes on, <i>If they were to speak upon
  <span class="pagenum" id="page186">{186}</span>the Stage it would follow of necessity, that the
  Expressions should be Lofty, Figurative, and Majestical</i>. It seems then their Behaviour should
  be agreeable to their Greatness. Why then are not these Rules observ'd, in the <i>Machines</i> of
  <i>Amphitrion</i>? <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'And as', corrected by
  Errata">As</span> I take it, Obscenity has not the Air of Majesty, nor any Alliance with the
  <i>Sublime</i>. And as for the <i>Figurative</i> Part, 'tis generally of the same Cut with the
  <i>Lofty</i>: The Smut shines clear, and strong, through the Metaphor, and is no better screen'd
  than the Sun by a Glass Window. To use <i>Mercury</i> thus ill, and make the God of Eloquence
  speak so unlike himself is somewhat strange! But tho' the <i>Antients</i> knew nothing of it,
  there are Considerations above those of <i>Decency</i>. And when this happens, <i>A Rule must
  rather be trespass'd on, than a Beauty left out</i>. 'Tis Mr. <i>Dryden's</i> opinion in his
  <i>Cleomenes</i>, where he breaks the <i>Unity of Time</i>, to describe the <i>Beauty</i> of a
  Famine.<span class="leftmar"><i>Pref.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref363"><a
  href="#side363">[363]</a></sup> Now Beauty is an arbitrary Advantage, and depends upon Custom and
  Fancy. With some People the Blackest Complexions are the handsomest. 'Tis to these <i>African</i>
  Criticks that Mr. <i>Dryden</i> seems to make his Appeal. And without doubt he bespeaks their
  Favour, and strikes their Imagination luckily enough. For to lodge Divinity and Scandal together;
  To make <span class="pagenum" id="page187">{187}</span>the Gods throw <i>Stars</i>, like
  <i>Snow-balls</i> at one another, but especially to Court in Smut, and rally in Blasphemy, is most
  admirably entertaining! This is much better than all the Niceties of <i>Decorum</i>. 'Tis
  handsomly contriv'd to slur the Notion of a Superiour Nature, to disarm the Terrors of Religion,
  and make the Court Above as Romantick as that of the <i>Fairies</i>. A Libertine when his
  Conscience is thus reliev'd, and Atheism sits easie upon his Spirits, can't help being grateful
  upon the Occasion. Meer Interest will oblige him to cry up the Performance, and solicit for the
  <i>Poets</i> Reputation! Before I take leave of these <i>Machines</i>, it may not be amiss to
  enquire why the Gods are brought into the <i>Spiritual Court</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>p.

  the Creditableness of the Business, and the <i>Poets</i> Kindness to those <i>Places</i>, are the
  principal Reasons of their coming. However. He might have a farther Design in his Head, and that
  is, to bring <i>Thebes</i> to <i>London</i>, and to show the Antiquity of <i>Doctors Commons</i>.
  For if you will believe <i>Mercury</i>, this Conference between him and <i>Ph&#x0153;bus</i> was
  held three thousand years ago.<span class="leftmar"><i>19.</i></span><sup class="handonly"

  <p>By the Pattern of these pretended <i>Deities</i>, we may guess what sort of <i>Mortals</i> we
  are likely to meet with. Neither are we mistaken. For <i>Phædra</i>, is bad enough in all
  Conscience, but <i>Bromia</i> is a meer Original. Indeed when Mr. <i>Dryden</i> makes
  <i>Jupiter</i>, and <i>Jupiter</i> makes the Women, little less can be expected. So much for

  a strange jumble and Hotch potch of Matters, if you mind it. Here we have <i>Genii</i>, and
  <i>Angels</i>, <i>Cupids</i>, <i>Syrens</i>, and <i>Devils</i>; <i>Venus</i> and St.
  <i>George</i>, <i>Pan</i> and the <i>Parson</i>, the Hell of Heathenism, and the Hell of
  <i>Revelation</i>; A fit of Smut, and then a Jest about Original Sin. And why are Truth and
  Fiction, Heathenism and Christianity, the most Serious and the most Trifling Things blended
  together, and thrown into one Form of Diversion? Why is all this done unless it be to ridicule the
  whole, and make one as incredible as the other? His <i>Airy</i> and <i>Earthy Spirits</i>
  discourse of the first state of Devils, of their <i>Chief</i> of their Revolt, their Punishment,
  and <span class="pagenum" id="page189">{189}</span>Impostures. This Mr. <i>Dryden</i> very
  Religiously calls a <i>Fairy way of Writing, which depends only on the Force of
  Imagination</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ep. Ded.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref369"><a
  href="#side369">[369]</a></sup> What then is the Fall of the Angels a Romance? Has it no basis of
  Truth, nothing to support it, but strength of Fancy, and Poetick Invention? After He had mention'd
  Hell, Devils, <i>&amp;c</i>. and given us a sort of <i>Bible</i> description of these formidable
  Things; I say after he had formed his Poem in this manner, I am surprized to hear him call it a
  <i>Fairy kind of Writing</i>. Is the History of <i>Tophet</i> no better prov'd than that of
  <i>Styx</i>? Is the Lake of <i>Brimstone</i> and that of <i>Phlegeton</i> alike dreadful? And have
  we as much Reason to believe the Torments of <i>Titius</i> and <i>Prometheus</i>, as those of the
  Devils and Damn'd? These are lamentable Consequences! And yet I can't well see how the <i>Poet</i>
  can avoid them. But setting aside this miserable Gloss in the <i>Dedication</i>, the
  Representation it self is scandalously irreligious. To droll upon the Vengeance of Heaven, and the
  Miseries of the Damn'd, is a sad Instance of Christianity! Those that bring Devils upon the
  <i>Stage</i>, can hardly believe them any where else. Besides, the Effects of such an
  Entertainment must needs be admirable! To see Hell thus play'd with is a mighty Refreshment to a
  lewd <span class="pagenum" id="page190">{190}</span>Conscience, and a byass'd Understanding. It
  heartens the Young Libertine, and confirms the well-wishers to Atheism, and makes Vice bold, and
  enterprising. Such Diversions serve to dispel the Gloom, and guild the Horrors of the <i>Shades
  below</i>, and are a sort of Ensurance against Damnation. One would think these <i>Poets</i> went
  upon absolute Certainty, and could demonstrate a Scheme of Infidelity. If they could, They had
  much better keep the Secret. The divulging it tends only to debauch Mankind, and shake the
  Securities of Civil Life. However, if they have been in the other World and find it empty, and
  uninhabited, and are acquainted with all the Powers, and Places, in Being; If they can show the
  Impostures of Religion, and the Contradictions of Common Belief, they have something to say for
  themselves. Have they then infallible Proof and Mathematick Evidence for these Discoveries? No Man
  had ever the Confidence to say This; And if He should, he would be but laughed at for his Folly.
  No Conclusions can exceed the Evidence of their Principles; you may as well build a Castle in the
  Air, as raise a Demonstration upon a Bottom of Uncertainty. And is any Man so vain as to pretend
  to know the Extent of Nature, and the Stretch of Possibility, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page191">{191}</span>and the Force of the Powers Invisible? So that notwithstanding the
  Boldness of this <i>Opera</i>, there may be such a Place as Hell; And if so, a Discourse about
  Devils, will be no <i>Fairy way of Writing</i>. For a <i>Fairy way of Writing</i>, is nothing but
  a <i>History of Fiction</i>; A subject of Imaginary Beings; such as never had any existence in
  Time, or Nature. And if as Monsieur <i>Rapin</i> observes, <i>Poetry</i> requires a mixture of
  Truth and <i>Fable</i>; Mr. <i>Dryden</i> may make his advantage, for his <i>Play</i> is much
  better founded on Reality than He was aware of.</p>

  <p>It may not be improper to consider in a word or two, what a frightfull Idea the <i>Holy
  Scriptures</i> give us of Hell. 'Tis describ'd by all the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'Circumstance', corrected
  by Errata">Circumstances</span> of Terror, by every Thing dreadful to Sense, and amazing to
  Thought. The Place, the Company, the Duration, are all Considerations of Astonishment. And why has
  God given us this solemn warning? Is it not to awaken our Fears, and guard our Happiness; To
  restrain the Disorders of Appetite, and to keep us within Reason, and Duty? And as for the
  <i>Apostate Angels</i>, the <i>Scriptures</i> inform us of their lost Condition, of their Malice
  and Power, of their active Industry and Experience; and all these Qualities <span class="pagenum"
  id="page192">{192}</span>Correspondent to the Bulk of their Nature, the Antiquity of their Being,
  and the Misery of their State. In short, They are painted in all the formidable Appearances
  imaginable, to alarm our Caution, and put us upon the utmost Defence.</p>

  <p>Let us see now how Mr. <i>Dryden</i> represents these unhappy Spirits, and their Place of
  Abode. Why very entertainingly! Those that have a true Tast for Atheism were never better regaled.
  One would think by this <i>Play</i> the Devils were meer Mormo's and Bugbears, fit only to fright
  Children and Fools. They rally upon Hell and Damnation, with a great deal of Air and Pleasantry;
  and appear like <i>Robin Good-fellow</i>, only to make the Company laugh. <i>Philidel</i>: Is
  call'd a <i>Puling Sprite</i>. And why so? For this pious reason, because</p>

  <p>The answer is, <i>What a half Devil's he</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page193">{193}</span></div>

  <p>You see how admirably it runs all upon the Christian Scheme! Sometimes they are
  <i>Half-Devils</i>, and sometimes <i>Hopeful-Devils</i>, and what you please to make sport with.
  <i>Grimbald</i> is afraid of being <i>whooped through Hell at his return</i>, for miscarrying in
  his Business. It seems there is great Leisure for Diversion! There's <i>Whooping</i> in Hell,
  instead of <i>Weeping</i> and <i>Wailing</i>! One would fancy Mr. <i>Dryden</i> had Daylight and
  Company, when these Lines were written. I know his Courage is extraordinary; But sure such
  Thoughts could never bear up against Solitude and a Candle!</p>

  <p>And now since he has diverted himself with the <i>Terrors</i> of <i>Christianity</i>, I dont
  wonder he, should treat those that Preach them with so much Civility! enter <i>Poet</i> in the
  Habit of a <i>Peasant</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p><i>We ha' cheated the Parson we'el cheat him again,</i></p>
    <p><i>For why should a Blockhead have one in ten?</i></p>

    <p><i>Till Pudding, and Dumpling burn to pot.</i></p>

  <p>These are fine comprehensive stroaks! Here you have the <i>Iliads</i> in a Nutshell! Two or
  three courtly words take in the whole Clergy; And what is wanting in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page194">{194}</span>Wit, is made up in Abuse, and that's as well. This is an admirable
  <i>Harvest Catch</i>, and the poor Tith-stealers stand highly indebted. They might have been tired
  with Cheating in <i>Prose</i>, had not they not been thus seasonably releiv'd in Doggrell! But now
  there is Musick in playing the Knave. A Countryman now may fill his Barn, and humour his ill
  Manners, and sing his Conscience asleep, and all under one. I dont question but these <i>four
  Lines</i> steal many a Pound in the year. Whether the <i>Muse</i> stands indictable or not, the
  Law must determine: But after all, I must say the Design is notably laid. For Place and Person,
  for Relish and Convenience; nothing could have been better. The Method is very short, clear, and
  Practicable. 'Tis a fine portable Infection, and costs no more Carriage than the Plague.</p>

  <p>Well! the Clergy must be contented: It might possibly have been worse for them if they had been
  in his favour: For he has sometimes a very unlucky way of showing his Kindness. He commends the
  <i>Earl of Leicester for considering the Friend, more than the Cause</i>;<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ep. Ded. Don Sebast.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref371"><a
  href="#side371">[371]</a></sup> that is, for his Partiality; The Marquess of <i>Halifax</i> for

  Pilots were made only for fair <span class="pagenum" id="page195">{195}</span>Weather. 'Tis
  Presum'd these Noble Persons are unconcern'd in this Character. However the <i>Poet</i> has shown
  his skill in Panegyrick, and 'tis only for that I mention it. He commends <i>Atticus</i> for his
  Trimming, and <i>Tally</i> for his Cowardize, and speaks meanly of the Bravery of
  <i>Cato</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Sebast. K. Arth.</i><br/>
  <i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref373"><a href="#side373">[373]</a></sup> Afterwards

  from Foreign Attempts</i> &amp;c.<sup class="handonly" id="ref374"><a
  href="#side374">[374]</a></sup> However he is in some pain about the Coming of the <i>Gauls</i>;
  'Tis possible for fear they should invade the <i>Muses</i>, and carry the <i>Opera's</i> into
  Captivity, and deprive us of <i>the Ornaments of Peace</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp5">And now He has serv'd his Friends, he comes in the last place like a modest Man, to
  commend Himself. He tells us there were a great many <i>Beauties</i> in the Original Draught of
  this <i>Play</i>. But it seems Time has since tarnish'd their Complexion. And He gives
  <i>Heroick</i> Reasons for their not appearing. To speak Truth, (all Politicks apart,) there are
  strange Flights of Honour, and Consistencies of Pretention in this Dedication! But I shall forbear
  the Blazon of the <i>Atcheivment</i>, for fear I should commend as unluckily as Himself.</p>

  <h4 class="sp3"><i>Remarks upon Don Quixot, &amp;c.</i></h4>

  <p>Mr. <i>Durfey</i> being somewhat particular in his Genius and Civilities, I shall consider him
  in a word or two by himself. This Poet writes from the <i>Romance</i> of an ingenious Author: By
  this means his Sense, and <i>Characters</i> are cut out to his Hand. He has wisely planted himself
  upon the shoulders of a <i>Giant</i>; but whether his Discoveries answer the advantage of his
  standing, the Reader must judge.</p>

  <p>What I have to object against Mr. <i>Durfey</i> shall most of it be ranged under these three
  Heads.</p>

  <p>I. <i>His Profaness with respect to Religion and the</i> Holy Scriptures.</p>

  <p>II. <i>His Abuse of the Clergy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">III. <i>His want of Modesty and Regard to the Audience.</i></p>

  <p>I. <i>His Profaness, &amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>And here my first Instance shall be in a bold <i>Song</i> against Providence.</p>

  <p>Here the <i>Poet</i> tells you Providence makes Mankind by halves, huddles up the Soul, and
  takes the least care of the better Moyety. This is direct blaspheming the Creation, and a Satir
  upon God Almighty. His next advance is to droll upon the Resurrection.</p>

  <p>In this and the following page, the <i>Redemption</i> of the World is treated with the same
  respect with the <i>Creation</i>. The word <i>Redeemer</i>, which among Christians is appropriated
  to our Blessed Saviour, and like the Jewish Tetragrammaton peculiarly reserv'd to the Deity; This
  adorable Name (<i>Redeemer and Dear Redeemer</i>,) is applyed to the ridiculous Don
  <i>Quixote</i>. These Insolencies are too big for the Correction of a Pen, and therefore I shall
  leave them. After this horrible abuse of the Works, and Attributes of God, he goes on to make
  sport with his Vengeance. He makes the Torments of Hell a very Comical Entertainment: As if they
  were only Flames in Painting, and Terrors in <i>Romance</i>. The <i>Stygian Frogs</i> in
  <i>Aristophanes</i> are not represented with more Levity, and Drolling. That the <i>Reader</i> may

  <p>In the second <i>Part</i> the Devil is brought upon the <i>Stage</i>.<span

  href="#side378">[378]</a></sup> He cries as <i>he hopes to be Saved</i>. And <i>Sancho warrants
  him a good Christian</i>. Truly I think he may have more of Christianity in him than the Poet. For
  he trembles at that God, with whom the other makes Diversion.</p>

  <p>I shall omit the mention of several outrages of this Kind, besides his deep mouth'd swearing,
  which is frequent, and pass on to the Second Head, which is His Abuse of the Clergy. And since
  Reveal'd Religion has been thus horribly treated, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page200">{200}</span>'tis no Wonder if the <i>Ministers</i> of it have the same Usage.</p>

  <p>And here we are likely to meet with some passages extraordinary enough. For to give Mr.
  <i>Durfey</i> his due, when he meddles with Church men he lays about him like a Knight Errant:
  Here his Wit and his Malice, are generally in extreams, tho' not of the same Kind. To begin. He
  makes the Curate <i>Perez</i> assist at the ridiculous Ceremony of <i>Don Quixots</i>
  Knighting.<span class="leftmar"><i>Part. 1. p. 13.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref379"><a
  href="#side379">[379]</a></sup> Afterwards Squire <i>Sancho</i> confessing his mistake to
  <i>Quixote</i>, tells him, <i>Ah consider dear Sir no man is born wise</i>. And what if he was
  born wise? He may be <i>Bred</i> a Fool, if he has not a care. But how does he prove this
  Memorable Sentence? Because a <i>Bishop is no more than another man without Grace and Good
  Breeding</i>. I must needs say if the <i>Poet</i> had any share of either of these Qualities, he
  would be less bold with his Superiors; and not give his Clowns the Liberty to droll thus heavily
  upon a solemn <i>Character</i>. This <i>Sancho</i> Mr. <i>Durfey</i> takes care to inform us is
  <i>a dry shrewd Country Fellow</i>, The reason of this Character is for the strength of it

  Peoples <i>Plays</i> are very shrewd Performances. To proceed. <i>Sancho</i> complains of his
  being married, because it hindred him from better offers. <i>Perez</i> the Curate is sorry for
  this Misfortune. <i>For as I remember</i> says he <i>'twas my luck to give</i> Teresa <i>and you

  Ceremonious as to submit: He is resolved to keep the Field against the Ladies; And endeavours to

  <p>By his favour, all Imitations tho' never so well Counterfeited are not proper for the
  <i>Stage</i>. To present Nature under every Appearance would be an odd undertaking. A Midnight
  <i>Cart</i>, or a <i>Dunghil</i> would be no Ornamental <i>Scene</i>. Nastyness, and dirty
  Conversation are of the same kind. For <i>Words</i> are a Picture to the Ear, as Colours and
  <i>Surface</i> are to the Eye. Such Discourses are like dilating upon Ulcers, and Leprosies: The
  more <span class="pagenum" id="page205">{205}</span><i>Natural</i>, the worse; for the Disgust
  always rises with the Life of the Description. Offensive Language like offensive Smells, does but
  make a Man's Senses a burthen, and affords him nothing but Loathing and Aversion. Beastliness in
  Behaviour, gives a disparaging Idea of Humane Nature, and almost makes us sorry we are of the same
  Kind. For these reasons 'tis a Maxime in Good Breeding never to shock the Senses, or Imagination.
  This Rule holds strongest before <i>Women</i>, and especially when they come to be entertain'd.
  The Diversion ought to be suited to the Audience; For nothing pleases which is disproportion'd to
  Capacity, and Gust. The Rudenesses and broad Jests of Beggars, are just as acceptable to Ladies as
  their Rags, and Cleanliness. To treat Persons of Condition like the <i>Mob</i>, is to degrade
  their Birth, and affront their Breeding. It levells them with the lowest Education. For the size
  of a Man's Sense, and Improvement, is discovered by his Pleasures, as much as by any thing
  else.</p>

  can judge of no farther than by the Rule of <i>ex pede Herculem</i>. I shall conclude with
  Monsieur <i>Boileau's Art</i> of <i>Poetry</i>. This citation may possibly be of some service to

  <h4 class="sp3"><i>Remarks upon the</i> Relapse.</h4>

  <p>The <i>Relapse</i> shall follow <i>Don Quixot</i>; upon the account of some Alliance between
  them. And because this <i>Author</i> swaggers so much in his <i>Preface</i>, and seems to look big
  upon his Performance, I shall spend a few more thoughts than ordinary upon his <i>Play</i>, and
  examine it briefly in the <i>Fable</i>, the <i>Moral</i>, the <i>Characters</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
  The Fable I take to be as follows.</p>

  <p>Fashion <i>a Lewd, Prodigal, younger Brother; is reduced to extremity: Upon his arrival from
  his Travels, he meets with</i> Coupler, <i>an old sharping Match-maker</i>; <i>This Man puts him
  upon a project of cheating his Elder Brother Lord</i> Foplington, <i>of a rich Fortune</i>.
  <i>Young</i> Fashion <i>being refused a Summ of Money by his Brother, goes into</i> Couplers
  <i>Plot, bubbles Sir</i> Tunbelly <i>of his Daughter, and makes himself Master of a fair
  Estate</i>.</p>

  <p>From the Form and Constitution of the <i>Fable</i>, I observe</p>

  <p>1st. That there is a <i>Misnommer</i> in the Title. The <i>Play</i> should not have been call'd
  the <i>Relapse, or Virtue in Danger</i>: <span class="pagenum"
  id="page210">{210}</span><i>Lovelace</i>, and <i>Amanda</i>, from whose <i>Characters</i> these
  Names are drawn, are Persons of Inferiour Consideration. <i>Lovelace</i> sinks in the middle of
  the <i>Fourth</i> Act, and we hear no more of him till towards the End of the <i>Fifth</i>, where
  he enters once more, but then 'tis as <i>Cato</i> did the Senate house, only to go out again. And
  as for <i>Amanda</i> she has nothing to do but to stand a shock of Courtship, and carry off her
  Virtue. This I confess is a great task in the <i>Play-house</i>, but no main matter in the
  <i>Play</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Intrigue</i>, and the <i>Discovery</i>, the great Revolution and success, turns upon
  <i>Young Fashion</i>. He without Competition, is the Principal Person in the <i>Comedy</i>. And
  therefore the <i>Younger Brother</i>, or the <i>Fortunate Cheat</i>, had been much a more proper
  Name. Now when a <i>Poet</i> can't rig out a <i>Title Page</i>, 'tis but a bad sign of his holding
  out to the <i>Epilogue</i>.</p>

  <p><i>2ly.</i> I observe the <i>Moral</i> is vitious: It points the wrong way, and puts the
  <i>Prize</i> into the wrong Hand. It seems to make <i>Lewdness</i> the reason of <i>Desert</i>,
  and gives <i>Young Fashion</i> a second Fortune, only for Debauching away his First. A short view
  of his <i>Character</i>, will make good this Reflection. To begin with him: He confesses himself a
  <i>Rake</i>, swears, and <span class="pagenum" id="page211">{211}</span>Blasphemes, Curses, and
  Challenges his Elder Brother, cheats him of his Mistress, and gets him laid by the Heels in a
  Dog-Kennel. And what was the ground of all this unnatural quarrelling and outrage? Why the main of
  it was only because Lord <i>Foplington</i> refused to supply his Luxury, and make good his
  Extravagance. This <i>Young Fashion</i> after all, is the <i>Poets</i> Man of Merit. He provides,
  a <i>Plot</i> and a Fortune, on purpose for him. To speak freely, A Lewd Character seldom wants
  good Luck in <i>Comedy</i>. So that when ever you see a thorough Libertine, you may almost swear
  he is in a rising way, and that the <i>Poet</i> intends to make him a great Man. In short; This
  <i>Play</i> perverts the End of <i>Comedy</i>: Which as Monsieur <i>Rapin</i> observes ought to
  regard Reformation, and publick Improvement. But the <i>Relapser</i> had a more fashionable Fancy
  in his Head.<span class="leftmar"><i>Reflect, &amp;c. p. 131.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref402"><a href="#side402">[402]</a></sup> His <i>Moral</i> holds forth this notable
  Instruction.</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> That all <i>Younger Brothers</i> should be careful to run out their Circumstances
  as Fast, and as Ill as they can. And when they have put their Affairs in this posture of
  Advantage, they may conclude themselves in the high Road to Wealth, and Success. For as
  <i>Fashion</i> Blasphemously applies it, <i>Providence takes care of Men of Merit.</i><span
  class="leftmar"><i>Relapse. p. 19</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref403"><a
  href="#side403">[403]</a></sup></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page212">{212}</span></div>

  <p><i>2ly.</i> That when a Man is press'd, his business is not to be govern'd by Scruples, or
  formalize upon Conscience and Honesty. The quickest Expedients are the best; For in such cases the
  Occasion justifies the Means, and a Knight of the <i>Post</i>, is as good as one of the
  <i>Garter</i>. In the</p>

  <p><i>3d.</i> Place it may not be improper to look a little into the <i>Plot</i>. Here the
  <i>Poet</i> ought to play the Politician if ever. This part should have some stroaks, of Conduct,
  and strains of Invention more then ordinary. There should be something that is admirable, and
  unexpected to surprize the Audience. And all this Finess must work by gentle degrees, by a due
  preparation of <i>Incidents</i>, and by Instruments which are probable.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Reflect.</i> <i>p. 133.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref404"><a
  href="#side404">[404]</a></sup> 'Tis Mr. <i>Rapins</i> remark, that without probability <i>every
  Thing is lame and Faulty</i>. Where there is no pretence to <i>Miracle</i> and <i>Machine</i>,
  matters must not exceed the force of Beleif. To produce effects without proportion; and likelyhood
  in the Cause, is Farce, and Magick, and looks more like Conjuring than Conduct. Let us examine the
  <i>Relapser</i> by these Rules. To discover his <i>Plot</i>, we must lay open somewhat more of the
  <i>Fable</i>.</p>

  <p>'Lord <i>Foplington</i> a Town Beau, had agreed to Marry the Daughter of Sir. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page213">{213}</span><i>Tun-belly Clumsey</i> a Country Gentleman, who lived
  Fifty miles from <i>London</i>. Notwithstanding this small distance, the Lord had never seen his
  Mistress, nor the Knight his Son in Law. Both parties out of their great Wisdom, leave the
  treating the Match to <i>Coupler</i>. When all the preliminaries of Settlement were adjusted, and
  Lord <i>Foplington</i> expected by Sir <i>Tun-belly</i> in a few days, <i>Coupler</i> betrays his
  Trust to <i>Young Fashion</i>. He advises him to go down before his Brother: To Counterfeit his
  Person, and pretend that the strength of his Inclinations brought him thither before his time, and
  without his Retinue. And to make him pass upon Sir <i>Tun-belly</i>, <i>Coupler</i> gives him his
  <i>Letter</i>, which was to be Lord <i>Foplingtons</i> Credential. <i>Young Fashion</i> thus
  provided, posts down to Sir <i>Tun-belly</i>, is received for Lord <i>Foplington</i>, and by the
  help of a little Folly and Knavery in the Family, Marries the young Lady without her Fathers
  Knowledge, and a week before the Appointment.</p>

  <p>This is the Main of the Contrivance. The Counterturn in Lord <i>Foplingtons</i> appearing
  afterwards, and the Support of the main <i>Plot</i>, by <i>Bulls</i>, and <i>Nurses</i> attesting
  the Marriage, contain's little of Moment. And here we may observe that <span class="pagenum"
  id="page214">{214}</span>Lord <i>Foplington</i> has an unlucky Disagreement in his
  <i>Character</i>; This Misfortune sits hard upon the credibility of the Design. Tis true he was
  Formal and Fantastick, Smitten with Dress, and Equipage, and it may be vapour'd by his Perfumes
  But his Behaviour is far from that of an Ideot.<span class="leftmar">p. 27.</span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref405"><a href="#side405">[405]</a></sup> This being granted, 'tis very
  unlikely this Lord with his five Thousand pounds <i>per annum</i>, should leave the choise of his
  Mistress to <i>Coupler</i>, and take her Person and Fortune upon <i>Content</i>. To court thus
  blindfold, and by <i>Proxy</i>, does not agree with the Method of an Estate, nor the Niceness of a
  <i>Beau</i>. However the <i>Poet</i> makes him engage Hand over Head, without so much as the sight
  of her Picture.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 79.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref406"><a
  href="#side406">[406]</a></sup> His going down to Sir <i>Tun-belly</i> was as extraordinary as his
  Courtship. He had never seen this Gentleman. He must know him to be beyond Measure suspicious, and
  that there was no Admittance without <i>Couplers</i> Letter. This <i>Letter</i> which was, the Key
  to the Castle, he forgot to take with him, and tells you <i>'twas stolen by his Brother Tam</i>.
  And for his part he neither had the Discretion to get another, nor yet to produce that written by
  him to Sir <i>Tun-belly</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref407"><a href="#side407">[407]</a></sup> Had common Sense been consulted upon this Occasion,
  the <i>Plot</i> had been at an End, and the <i>Play</i> had sunk <span class="pagenum"
  id="page215">{215}</span>in the Fourth <i>Act</i>. The Remainder subsists purely upon the strength
  of Folly, and of Folly altogether improbable, and out of <i>Character</i>. The <i>Salvo</i> of Sir
  <i>John Friendly's</i> appearing at last, and vouching for Lord <i>Foplington</i>, won't mend the
  matter. For as the <i>Story</i> informs us, Lord <i>Foplington</i> never depended on this
  Reserve.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 81.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref408"><a
  href="#side408">[408]</a></sup> He knew nothing of this Gentleman being in the Country, nor where
  he Lived. The truth is, Sir <i>John</i> was left in <i>Town</i>, and the Lord had neither
  concerted his journey with him, nor engaged his Assistance.<span class="leftmar"><i>p.
  83.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref409"><a href="#side409">[409]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Let us now see how Sir. <i>Tun-belly</i> hangs together. This Gentleman the <i>Poet</i> makes a
  <i>Justice</i> of <i>Peace</i>, and a <i>Deputy Lieutenant</i>, and seats him fifty Miles from
  <i>London</i>: But by his Character you would take him for one of <i>Hercules</i>'s Monsters, or
  some Gyant in <i>Guy</i> of <i>Warwick</i>. His Behaviour is altogether <i>Romance</i>, and has
  nothing agreeable to Time, or Country. When <i>Fashion</i>, and <i>Lory</i>, went down, they find
  the Bridge drawn up, the Gates barr'd, and the Blunderbuss cock'd at the first civil Question. And
  when Sir <i>Tun-belly</i> had notice of this formidable Appearance, he Sallies out with the
  <i>Posse</i> of the Family, and marches against a Couple of Strangers with a <i>Life Gaurd</i> of
  Halberds, Sythes, <span class="pagenum" id="page216">{216}</span>and Pitchforks. And to make sure
  work, Young <i>Hoyden</i> is lock'd up at the first approach of the Enemy. Here you have prudence
  and wariness to the excess of Fable, and Frensy. And yet this mighty man of suspition, trusts
  <i>Coupler</i> with the Disposal of his only Daughter, and his Estate into the Bargain. And what
  was this <i>Coupler</i>? Why, a sharper by <i>Character</i>, and little better by Profession.
  Farther. Lord <i>Foplington</i> and the Knight, are but a days Journey asunder, and yet by their
  treating by Proxy, and Commission, one would Fancy a dozen Degrees of <i>Latitude</i> betwixt
  them. And as for Young <i>Fashion</i>, excepting <i>Couplers</i> Letter, he has all imaginable
  Marks of Imposture upon him. He comes before his Time, and without the Retinue expected, and has
  nothing of the Air of Lord <i>Foplington's</i> Conversation. When Sir <i>Tun-belly</i> ask'd him,
  <i>pray where are your Coaches and Servants my Lord</i>? He makes a trifling excuse. <i>Sir, that
  I might give you and your Fair Daughter a proof how impatient I am to be nearer akin to you, I
  left my Equipage to follow me, and came away Post, with only one Servant.</i><span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 59.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref410"><a
  href="#side410">[410]</a></sup> To be in such a Hurry of Inclination for a Person he never saw, is
  somewhat strange! Besides, 'tis very unlikely Lord <i>Foplington</i> should hazard his <span
  class="pagenum" id="page217">{217}</span>Complexion on Horseback, out ride his Figure, and appear
  a Bridegroom in <i>Deshabille</i>. You may as soon perswade a Peacock out of his Train, as a
  <i>Beau</i> out of his Equipage; especially upon such an Occasion. Lord <i>Foplington</i> would
  scarsely speak to his Brother just come a <i>Shore</i>, till the Grand Committee of <i>Taylors,
  Seamtresses, &amp;c.</i> was dispatch'd.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 11.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref411"><a href="#side411">[411]</a></sup> Pomp, and Curiosity were this
  Lords Inclination; why then should he mortifie without necessity, make his first Approaches thus
  out of Form and present himself to his Mistress at such Disadvantage? And as this is the Character
  of Lord <i>Foplington</i>, so 'tis reasonable to suppose Sir <i>Tunbelly</i> acquainted with it.
  An enquiry into the Humour and management of a Son in Law, is very natural and Customary. So that
  we can't without Violence to Sense, suppose Sir <i>Tunbelly</i> a Stranger to Lord
  <i>Foplington</i>'s Singularities. These Reasons were enough in all Conscience to make Sir
  <i>Tunbelly</i> suspect a Juggle, and that <i>Fashion</i> was no better then a Counterfeit. Why
  then was the <i>Credential</i> swallow'd without chewing, why was not <i>Hoyden</i> lock'd up, and
  a pause made for farther Enquiry? Did this <i>Justice</i> never hear of such a Thing as Knavery,
  or had he ever greater reason to guard against it? More wary steps <span class="pagenum"
  id="page218">{218}</span>might well have been expected from Sir <i>Tunbelly</i>. To run from one
  extream of Caution, to another of Credulity, is highly improbable. In short, either Lord
  <i>Foplington</i> and Sir <i>Tunbelly</i> are Fools, or they are not. If they are, where lies the
  Cunning in over-reaching them? What Conquest can there be without Opposition? If they are not
  Fools, why does the <i>Poet</i> make them so? Why is their Conduct so gross, so particolour'd, and
  inconsistent? Take them either way, and the <i>Plot</i> miscarries. The first supposition makes it
  dull, and the later, incredible. So much for the <i>Plot</i>. I shall now in the</p>

  <p><i>4th</i>. Place touch briefly upon the <i>Manners</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Manners</i> in the Language of the <i>Stage</i> have a signification somewhat
  particular. <i>Aristotle</i> and <i>Rapin</i> call them the Causes and Principles of Action. They
  are formed upon the Diversities of Age, and Sex, of Fortune, Capacity, and Education. The
  propriety of <i>Manners</i> consists in a Conformity of Practise, and Principle; of Nature, and
  Behaviour. For the purpose. An old Man must not appear with the Profuseness and Levity of Youth; A
  Gentleman must not talk like a Clown, nor a Country Girl like a Town Jilt. And when the
  <i>Characters</i> are feign'd <span class="pagenum" id="page219">{219}</span>'tis <i>Horace</i>'s
  Rule to keep them Uniform, and consistent, and agreeable to their first setting out. The
  <i>Poet</i> must be careful to hold his <i>Persons</i> tight to their <i>Calling</i> and
  pretentions. He must not shift, and shuffle, their Understandings; Let them skip from Wits to
  Blockheads, nor from Courtiers to Pedants; On the other hand. If their business is playing the
  Fool, keep them strictly to their Duty, and never indulge them in fine Sentences. To manage
  otherwise, is to desert <i>Nature</i>, and makes the <i>Play</i> appear monstrous, and Chimerical.
  So that instead of an <i>Image of Life</i>, 'tis rather an Image of Impossibility. To apply some
  of these remarks to the <i>Relapser</i>.</p>

  <p>The fine <i>Berinthia</i>, one of the Top-Characters, is impudent and Profane. <i>Lovelace</i>
  would engage her Secrecy, and bids her Swear. She answers <i>I do</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lov.</i> By what?</p>

  <p>Berinth. <i>By Woman.</i></p>

  <p>Lov. <i>That's Swearing by my Deity, do it by your own, or I shan't believe you.</i></p>

  <p>Berinth. <i>By Man then.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>p. 47.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref412"><a href="#side412">[412]</a></sup></p>

  <p>This Lady promises <i>Worthy</i> her Endeavours to corrupt <i>Amanda</i>; and then They make a
  Profane jest upon the Office.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 51.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref413"><a href="#side413">[413]</a></sup> In the progress of the <i>Play</i> after a great
  deal of Lewd Discourse with <i>Lovelace</i>, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page220">{220}</span><i>Berinthia</i> is carried off into a Closet, and Lodged in a
  <i>Scene</i> of Debauch.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 74.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref414"><a href="#side414">[414]</a></sup> Here is Decency, and Reservedness, to a great
  exactness! Monsieur <i>Rapin</i> blames <i>Ariosto</i>, and <i>Tasso</i>, for representing two of
  their Women over free, and airy.<span class="leftmar"><i>Reflect. p. 40.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref415"><a href="#side415">[415]</a></sup> These <i>Poets</i> says he, <i>rob
  Women of their Character, which is Modesty</i>. Mr. <i>Rymer</i> is of the same Opinion: His words
  are these. <i>Nature knows nothing in the Manners which so properly, and particularly distinguish
  a Woman, as her Modesty.&mdash;&mdash;An impudent Woman is fit only to be kicked, and expos'd in
  Comedy.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Tragedies of the last Age consider'd, &amp;c. p. 113,
  114.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref416"><a href="#side416">[416]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Now <i>Berinthia</i> appears in <i>Comedy</i> 'tis true; but neither to be <i>kick'd</i>, nor
  <i>expos'd</i>. She makes a Considerable Figure, has good Usage, keeps the best Company, and goes
  off without Censure, or Disadvantage. Let us now take a Turn or two with Sir <i>Tun-belly's</i>
  Heiress of 1500 pounds a year. This Young Lady swears, talks smut, and is upon the matter just as
  rag-manner'd as <i>Mary the Buxsome</i>. 'Tis plain the <i>Relapser</i> copyed Mr. <i>Durfey's</i>
  Original, which is a sign he was somewhat Pinch'd. Now this <i>Character</i> was no great Beauty
  in <i>Buxsome</i>; But it becomes the Knights Daughter much worse. <i>Buxsome</i> was a poor
  Pesant, which made her Rudeness more natural, and expected. But <i>Deputy Lieutenants</i> Children
  don't <span class="pagenum" id="page221">{221}</span>use to appear with the Behaviour of Beggars.
  To breed all People alike, and make no distinction between a <i>Seat</i>, and a <i>Cottage</i>, is
  not over artful, nor very ceremonious to the Country Gentlemen. The <i>Relapser</i> gives
  <i>Miss</i> a pretty Soliloquy, I'll transcribe it for <i>the Reader</i>.</p>

  <p>She swears by her Maker, <i>'tis well I have a Husband a coming, or I'de Marry the Baker I
  would so. No body can knock at the Gate, but presently I must be lock'd up, and, here's the Young
  Gray-hound&mdash;&mdash;can run loose about the House all day long, she can, 'tis very
  well!</i>!<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 59.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref417"><a
  href="#side417">[417]</a></sup> Afterwards her Language is too Lewd to be quoted. Here is a
  Compound of Ill Manners, and Contradiction Is this a good Resemblance of Quality, a Description of
  a great Heiress, and the effect of a Cautious Education? By her Coarsness you would think her Bred
  upon a Common, and by her Confidence, in the Nursery of the <i>Play-house</i>. I suppose the
  <i>Relapser</i> Fancies the calling her <i>Miss Hoyden</i> is enough to justifie her Ill Manners.
  By his favour, this is a Mistake. To represent her thus unhewn, he should have suited her
  Condition to her Name, a little better. For there is no Charm in <i>Words</i> as to matters of
  Breeding, An unfashionable Name won't make a Man a Clown. Education is not form'd upon <span
  class="pagenum" id="page222">{222}</span>Sounds, and Syllables, but upon Circumstances, and
  Quality. So that if he was resolv'd to have shown her thus unpolish'd, he should have made her
  keep <i>Sheep</i>, or brought her up at the <i>Wash-Boul</i>.</p>

  <p>Sir <i>Tun-belly</i> accosts Young <i>Fashion</i> much at the same rate of Accomplishment.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 61.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref418"><a
  href="#side418">[418]</a></sup> My Lord,&mdash;&mdash;<i>I humbly crave leave to bid you Welcome
  in <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Cup', corrected by
  Errata">a Cup</span> of Sack-wine</i>. One would imagine the <i>Poet</i> was overdozed before he
  gave the <i>Justice</i> a Glass. For <i>Sack-wine</i> is too low for a <i>Petty Constable</i>.
  This peasantly expression agrees neither with the Gentlemans Figure, nor with the rest of his
  Behaviour. I find we should have a Creditable <i>Magistracy</i>, if the <i>Relapser</i> had the
  Making them. Here the <i>Characters</i> are pinch'd in Sense, and stinted to short Allowance. At
  an other time they are over-indulged, and treated above Expectation.</p>

  <p>For the purpose. Vanity and Formalizing is Lord <i>Foplingtons</i> part. To let him speak
  without Aukwardness, and Affectation, is to put him out of his Element. There must be Gumm and
  stiffening in his Discourse to make it natural However, the <i>Relapser</i> has taken a fancy to
  his Person, and given him some of the most Gentile raillery in the whole <i>Play</i>. To give an
  Instance or two. This Lord <span class="pagenum" id="page223">{223}</span>in Discourse with
  <i>Fashion</i> forgets his Name, flies out into Sense, and smooth expression, out talks his
  Brother, and abating the starch'd Similitude of a <i>Watch</i>, discovers nothing of Affectation,
  for almost a <i>Page</i> together.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 42.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref419"><a href="#side419">[419]</a></sup> He relapses into the same Intemperance of good
  Sense, in an other Dialogue between him and his Brother. I shall cite a little of it.</p>

  <p><i>Y.</i> Fash. <i>Unless you are so kind to assist me in redeeming my Annuity, I know no
  Remedy, but to go take a Purse</i>.</p>

  <p><i>L.</i> Fopl. <i>Why Faith</i> Tam&mdash;&mdash;<i>to give you my Sense of the Thing, I do
  think taking a Purse the best Remedy in the World, for if you succeed, you are releiv'd that way,

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page224">{224}</span></div>

  <p>This Drolling has too much Spirit, the Air of it is too free, and too handsomly turn'd for Lord
  <i>Foplingtons</i> Character. I grant the <i>Relapser</i> could not aford to lose these Sentences.
  The Scene would have suffer'd by the Omission. But then he should have contriv'd the matter so, as
  that they might, have been spoken by Young <i>Fashion</i> in <i>Asides</i>, or by some other more
  proper Person. To go on. Miss <i>Hoyden</i> sparkles too much in Conversation. The <i>Poet</i>
  must needs give her a shining Line or two,<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 64. At top.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref422"><a href="#side422">[422]</a></sup> which serves only to make the rest
  of her dullness the more remarkable. Sir. <i>Tun-belly</i> falls into the same Misfortune of a
  Wit, and rallies above the force of his Capacity.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 85.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref423"><a href="#side423">[423]</a></sup> But the place having a mixture of
  Profaness, I shall forbear to cite it. Now to what purpose should a Fools Coat be embroider'd?
  Finery in the wrong place is but expensive Ridiculousness. Besides, I don't perceive the
  <i>Relapser</i> was in any Condition to be thus liberal. And when a <i>Poet</i> is not
  overstock'd, to squander away his Wit among his <i>Block-heads</i>, is meer Distraction. His men
  of Sense will smart for this prodigality. <i>Lovelace</i> in his discourse of <i>Friendship</i>,
  shall be the first Instance. <i>Friendship</i> (says he) <i>is said to be a plant of tedious
  growth, its Root composed of tender</i> Fibers, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page225">{225}</span>nice in their Tast, <i>&amp;c.</i> By this Description the Palate of a
  <i>Fiber</i>, should be somewhat more <i>nice</i> and distinguishing, then the <i>Poets</i>
  Judgment. Let us examin some more of his Witty People. Young <i>Fashion</i> fancies by
  <i>Misses</i> forward Behaviour, she would have a whole <i>Kennel</i> of <i>Beaux</i> after her at
  <i>London</i>. And then <i>Hey to the Park, and the Play, and the Church, and the Devil</i>.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 64.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref424"><a
  href="#side424">[424]</a></sup> Here I conceive the ranging of the Period is amiss. For if he had
  put the <i>Play</i>, and the <i>Devil</i> together, the Order of Nature, and the Air of
  Probability had been much better observ'd.</p>

  <p>Afterwards <i>Coupler</i> being out of Breath in coming up stairs to <i>Fashion</i>, asks him
  <i>why the &mdash;&mdash; canst thou not lodge upon the Ground-floor</i>?<span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 94.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref425"><a
  href="#side425">[425]</a></sup></p>

  <p><i>Y.</i> Fash. <i>Because I love to lye as near Heaven as I can.</i> One would think a Spark
  just come off his Travels, and had made the <i>Tour</i> of <i>Italy</i> and <i>France</i>, might
  have rallied with a better Grace! However if he lodg'd in a <i>Garret</i>, 'tis a good
  <i>Local</i> jest. I had almost forgot one pretty remarkable Sentence of <i>Fashion</i> to
  <i>Lory.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>p. 15.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref426"><a
  href="#side426">[426]</a></sup> <i>I shall shew thee</i> (says he) <i>the excess of my Passion by
  being very calm</i>. Now since this <i>Gentleman</i> was in a vein of talking Philosophy to his
  Man, I'm sorry he broke of so quickly. Had he gone on and shown <span class="pagenum"
  id="page226">{226}</span>him the <i>Excess</i> of a Storm and no Wind stirring, the Topick had
  been spent, and the Thought improv'd to the utmost.</p>

  <p>Let us now pass onto <i>Worthy</i>, the <i>Relapsers</i> fine Gentleman. This Spark sets up for
  Sense, and Address, and is to have nothing of Affectation or Conscience to spoil his Character.
  However to say no more of him, he grows Foppish in the last <i>Scene</i>, and courts <i>Amanda</i>
  in Fustian, and Pedantry. First, He gives his Periods a turn of Versification, and talks
  <i>Prose</i> to her in <i>Meeter</i>. Now this is just as agreeable as it would be to <i>Ride</i>
  with one Leg, and <i>Walk</i> with the other. But let him speak for himself. His first business is
  to bring <i>Amanda</i> to an Aversion for her Husband; And therefore he perswades her to <i>Rouse
  up that Spirit Women ought to bear; and slight your God if he neglects his Angel</i>.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>p. 99.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref427"><a
  href="#side427">[427]</a></sup> He goes on with his Orisons. <i>With Arms of Ice receive his Cold
  Embraces and keep your Fire for those that come in Flames.</i> Fire and Flames, is Mettal upon
  Mettal; 'Tis false Heraldry. <i>Extend the Arms of Mercy to his Aid. His zeal may give him Title
  to your Pity, altho' his Merit cannot claim your Love.</i><span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref428"><a
  href="#side428">[428]</a></sup> Here you have <i>Arms</i> brought in again by Head and shoulders.
  I suppose the design was to keep up the Situation of the <i>Allegory</i>. But the latter <span
  class="pagenum" id="page227">{227}</span>part of the Speech is very Pithy. He would have her
  resign her Vertue out of Civility, and abuse her Husband on Principles of good Nature.
  <i>Worthy</i> pursues his point, and Rises in his Address. He falls into a Fit of Dissection, and
  hopes to gain his Mistress by Cutting his Throat. He is for <i>Ripping up his Faithful Breast</i>,
  to prove the Reality of his Passion. Now when a Man Courts with his Heart in his Hand, it must be
  great Cruelty to refuse him! No Butcher could have Thought of a more moving Expedient! However,
  <i>Amanda</i> continues obstinate, and is not in the usual Humour of the <i>Stage</i>. Upon this,
  like a well bred Lover he seizes her by Force, and threatens to Kill her. <i>Nay struggle not for
  all's in vain, or Death, or Victory, I am determin'd.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>p.
  100.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref429"><a href="#side429">[429]</a></sup> In this
  rencounter the Lady proves too nimble, and slips through his Fingers. Upon this disappointment, he
  cries, <i>there's Divinity about her, and she has dispenc'd some Portion on't to me</i>. His
  Passion is Metamorphos'd in the Turn of a hand: He is refin'd into a <i>Platonick</i> Admirer, and
  goes off as like a <i>Town Spark</i> as you would wish. And so much for the <i>Poets</i> fine
  Gentleman.</p>

  <p>I should now examine the <i>Relapser's Thoughts and Expressions</i>, which are two other Things
  of Consideration in a <i>Play</i>. <span class="pagenum" id="page228">{228}</span>The
  <i>Thoughts</i> or <i>Sentiments are the Expressions of the Manners, as Words are of the
  Thoughts</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Rapin Reflect, &amp;c.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref430"><a href="#side430">[430]</a></sup> But the view of the <i>Characters</i> has in some
  measure prevented this Enquiry. Leaving this Argument therefore, I shall consider his <i>Play</i>
  with respect to the</p>

  <p><i>Three Unities</i> of Time, Place, and Action.</p>

  <p>And here the <i>Reader</i> may please to take notice, that the Design of these Rules, is to
  conceal the Fiction of the <i>Stage</i>, to make the <i>Play</i> appear Natural, and to give it an
  Air of Reality, and <i>Conversation</i>.</p>

  <p>The largest compass for the first <i>Unity</i> is Twenty Four Hours: But a lesser proportion is
  more regular. To be exact, the Time of the History, or <i>Fable</i>, should not exceed that of the
  <i>Representation</i>: Or in other words, the whole Business of the <i>Play</i>, should not be
  much longer than the Time it takes up in <i>Playing</i>.</p>

  <p>The Second <i>Unity</i> is that of <i>Place</i>. To observe it, the <i>Scene</i> must not
  wander from one Town, or Country to another. It must continue in the same House, Street, or at
  farthest in the same City, where it was first laid. The Reason of this Rule depends upon the
  <i>First</i>. Now the Compass of <i>Time</i> being strait, that of <i>Space</i> must bear a
  Correspondent Proportion. <span class="pagenum" id="page229">{229}</span>Long journeys in
  <i>Plays</i> are impracticable. The Distances of <i>Place</i> must be suited to Leisure, and
  Possibility, otherwise the supposition will appear unnatural and absurd. The</p>

  <p>Third <i>Unity</i> is that of <i>Action</i>; It consists in contriving the chief Business of
  the <i>Play</i> single, and making the concerns of one Person distinguishably great above the
  rest. All the Forces of the <i>Stage</i> must as it were serve Under one <i>General</i>: And the
  lesser Intrigues or Underplots, have some Relation to the Main. The very Oppositions must be
  useful, and appear only to be Conquer'd, and Countermin'd. To represent Two considerable Actions
  independent of each other, Destroys the beauty of Subordination, weakens the Contrivance, and
  dilutes the pleasure. It splits the <i>Play</i>, and makes the <i>Poem</i> double. He that would
  see more upon this subject may consult <i>Corneille</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Discourse des
  Trois Unitez. pt. 3d.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref431"><a
  href="#side431">[431]</a></sup> To bring these Remarks to the Case in hand. And here we may
  observe how the <i>Relapser</i> fails in all the <i>Rules</i> above mention'd.</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> His <i>Play</i> by modest Computation takes up a weeks Work, but five days you must
  allow it at the lowest. One day must be spent in the First, Second, and part of the Third
  <i>Act</i>, before Lord <i>Foplington</i> sets forward to Sir <i>Tun-belly</i>. Now the Length
  <span class="pagenum" id="page230">{230}</span>of the Distance, the Pomp of the Retinue, and the
  Niceness of the Person being consider'd; the journey down, and up again, cannot be laid under four
  days.<span class="leftmar"><i>p. 88.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref432"><a
  href="#side432">[432]</a></sup> To put this out of doubt, Lord, <i>Foplington</i> is particularly
  careful to tell <i>Coupler</i>, how concern'd he was not to overdrive <i>for fear of disordering
  his Coach-Horses</i>. The Laws of <i>Place</i>, are no better observ'd than those of <i>Time</i>.
  In the Third <i>Act</i> the <i>Play</i> is in <i>Town</i>, in the Fourth <i>Act</i> 'tis stroll'd
  Fifty Miles off, and in the Fifth <i>Act</i> in <i>London</i> again. Here <i>Pegasus</i> stretches
  it to purpose! This <i>Poet</i> is fit to ride a Match with Witches. <i>Juliana Cox</i> never
  Switched a Broom stock with more Expedition! This is exactly</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Titus</i> at <i>Walton Town</i>, and <i>Titus</i> at <i>Islington</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>One would think by the probability of matters, the <i>Plot</i> had been stolen from Dr.
  <i>O&mdash;&mdash;s</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Poet's</i> Success in the last <i>Unity</i> of <i>Action</i> is much the same with the
  former. <i>Lovelace</i>, <i>Amanda</i>, and <i>Berinthia</i>, have no share in the main Business.
  These Second rate <i>Characters</i> are a detatched Body: Their Interest is perfectly Foreign, and
  they are neither Friends, nor Enemies to <span class="pagenum" id="page231">{231}</span>the
  <i>Plot</i>. <i>Young Fashion</i> does not so much as see them till the Close of the Fifth
  <i>Act</i>, and then they meet only to fill the <i>Stage</i>: And yet these <i>Persons</i> are in
  the <i>Poets</i> account very considerable; Insomuch that he has misnamed his <i>Play</i> from the
  Figure of two of them. This strangness of <i>Persons</i>, distinct Company, and inconnexion of
  Affairs, destroys the Unity of the <i>Poem</i>. The contrivance is just as wise as it would be to
  cut a Diamond in two. There is a loss of Lustre in the Division. Increasing the Number, abates the
  Value, and by making it more, you make it less.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Thus far I have examin'd the <i>Dramatick</i> Merits of the <i>Play</i>. And upon
  enquiry, it appears a Heap of Irregularities. There is neither Propriety in the <i>Name</i>, nor
  Contrivance in the <i>Plot</i>, nor Decorum in the <i>Characters</i>. 'Tis a thorough Contradition
  to Nature, and impossible in <i>Time</i>, and <i>Place</i>. Its <i>Shining Graces</i> as the
  Author calls them,<span class="leftmar"><i>Pref.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref433"><a
  href="#side433">[433]</a></sup> are <i>Blasphemy</i> and <i>Baudy</i>, together with a mixture of
  <i>Oaths</i>, and <i>Cursing</i>. Upon the whole; The <i>Relapser's</i> Judgment, and his Morals,
  are pretty well adjusted. The <i>Poet</i>, is not much better than the <i>Man</i>. As for the
  <i>Profane</i> part, 'tis hideous and superlative.<span class="leftmar"><i>see Chap.
  2d.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref434"><a href="#side434">[434]</a></sup> But this I have
  consider'd elsewhere. All that I shall observe here is, that the Author was <span class="pagenum"
  id="page232">{232}</span>sensible of this Objection. His Defence in his <i>Preface</i> is most
  wretched: He pretends to know nothing of the Matter, and that <i>'tis all Printed</i>; Which only
  proves his Confidence equal to the rest of his Virtues. To out-face Evidence in this manner, is
  next to the affirming there's no such Sin as <i>Blasphemy</i>, which is the greatest Blasphemy of
  all. His Apology consists in railing at the <i>Clergy</i>; a certain sign of ill Principles, and
  ill Manners. This He does at an unusual rate of Rudeness and Spite. He calls them the Saints with
  Screw'd <i>Faces, and wry Mouths</i>. And after a great deal of scurrilous Abuse too gross to be
  mention'd, he adds;<span class="leftmar"><i>Pref.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref435"><a
  href="#side435">[435]</a></sup> <i>If any Man happens to be offended at a story of a Cock and a

  <p>Having in the foregoing <i>Chapters</i> discover'd some part of the Disorders of the <i>English
  Stage</i>; I shall in this Last, present the <i>Reader</i> with a short View of the Sense of
  <i>Antiquity</i>, To which I shall add some <i>Modern</i> Authorities; From all which it will
  appear that <i>Plays</i> have generally been look'd on as the <i>Nurseries</i> of <i>Vice</i>, the
  <i>Corrupters</i> of <i>Youth</i>, and the <i>Grievance</i> of the <i>Country</i> where they are
  suffer'd.</p>

  <p>This proof from <i>Testimony</i> shall be ranged under these three Heads.</p>

  <p>Under the <i>First</i>, I shall cite some of the most celebrated <i>Heathen Philosophers</i>,
  Orators, and Historians; Men of the biggest Consideration, for Sense, Learning, and Figure.
  The</p>

  <p><i>Second</i>, Shall consist of the <i>Laws</i> and <i>Constitutions</i> of <i>Princes,
  &amp;c.</i> The</p>

  <p><i>Third</i>, Will be drawn from <i>Church-Records</i>, from <i>Fathers</i>, and
  <i>Councils</i> of <span class="pagenum" id="page234">{234}</span>unexceptionable Authority, both
  as to Persons, and Time.</p>

  <p><i>1st.</i> I shall produce some of the most celebrated Heathen Philosophers <i>&amp;c.</i> To
  begin with <i>Plato</i>. 'This Philosopher tells us that <i>Plays</i> raise the Passions, and
  pervert the use of them, and by consequence are dangerous to Morality. For this Reason he banishes
  these Diversions his <i>Common-Wealth</i>.'<span class="leftmar"><i>Plat. de Repub. Lib. 10.<br/>
  Euseb. Præpar. Evang.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref437"><a
  href="#side437">[437]</a></sup></p>

  <p><i>Xenophon</i> who was both a Man of <i>Letters</i> and a great <i>General</i>, commends the
  <i>Persians</i> for the Discipline of their Education. 'They won't (says he) so much as suffer
  their Youth to hear any thing that's Amorous or Tawdry.'<span class="leftmar"><i>Cyropæd. p.
  34</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref438"><a href="#side438">[438]</a></sup> They were afraid
  want of Ballast might make them miscarry, and that 'twas dangerous to add weight to the Byass of
  Nature.</p>

  <p><i>Aristole</i> lays it down for a Rule 'that the Law ought to forbid Young People the seeing
  of <i>Comedies</i>. Such permissions not being safe till Age and Discipline had confirm'd them in
  sobriety, fortified their Virtue, and made them as it were proof against Debauchery.'<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Polit. Lib. 7. c. p. 12.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref439"><a
  href="#side439">[439]</a></sup> This Philosopher who had look'd as far into Humane Nature as any
  Man, observes farther. 'That the force of Musick and <i>Action</i> is very affecting. It commands
  the Audience and changes the Passions to <span class="pagenum" id="page235">{235}</span>a
  Resemblance of the Matter before them.'<span class="leftmar"><i>Polit. Lib. 8.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref440"><a href="#side440">[440]</a></sup> So that where the Representation
  is foul, the Thoughts of the Company must suffer.</p>

  <p><i>Tully</i> crys out upon 'Licentious <i>Plays</i> and <i>Poems</i>, as the bane of Sobriety,
  and wise Thinking: That <i>Comedy</i> subsists upon Lewdness, and that Pleasure is the Root, of
  all Evil.'<span class="leftmar"><i>Tusc. Quest. Lib. 4.<br/>

  <p><i>Livy</i>, reports the Original of <i>Plays</i> among the <i>Romans</i>. 'He tells us they
  were brought in upon the score of Religion, to pacifie the Gods, and remove a <i>Mortality</i>.
  But then He adds that the Motives are sometimes good, when the Means are stark naught: That the
  Remedy in this case was worse than the Disease, and the Atonement more Infectious then the
  Plague.'<span class="leftmar"><i>Dec. 1. Lib. 7.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref442"><a
  href="#side442">[442]</a></sup></p>

  <p><i>Valerius Maximus</i>, Contemporary with <i>Livy</i>, gives much the same Account of the rise
  of <i>Theatres</i> at <i>Rome</i>. 'Twas Devotion which built them. And as for the Performances of
  those Places, which Mr. <i>Dryden</i> calls the <i>Ornaments</i>, this Author censures as the
  Blemishes of <i>Peace</i>.' And which is more, He affirms 'They were the Occasions of Civil
  Distractions; And that the <i>State</i> first Blush'd, and then Bled, for the Entertainment.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Lib. 2. cap. 4.</i><br/>
  <i>cap. 6.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref443"><a href="#side443">[443]</a></sup> He

  id="page236">{236}</span>intolerable;<sup class="handonly" id="ref444"><a
  href="#side444">[444]</a></sup> And that the <i>Massilienses</i> did well in clearing the Country
  of them. <i>Seneca</i> complains heartily of the Extravagance and Debauchery of the Age: And how
  forward People were to improve in that which was naught. That scarce any Body would apply
  themselves to the Study of Nature and Morality, unless when the <i>Play-House</i> was shut, or the
  Weather foul. That there was no body to teach <i>Philosophy</i>, because there was no body to
  Learn it: But that the <i>Stage</i> had <i>Nurseries</i>, and Company enough. This Misapplication
  of time and Fancy, made Knowledge in so ill a Condition. This was the Cause the Hints of Antiquity
  were no better pursued; that some Inventions were sunk, and that Humane Reason grew Downwards
  rather than otherwise.<span class="leftmar"><i>Natural Quest. Lib. 7. cap. 32.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref445"><a href="#side445">[445]</a></sup> And elswhere he avers that there

  class="leftmar"><i>Epist. 7.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref446"><a
  href="#side446">[446]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'<i>Tacitus</i> relating how <i>Nero</i> hired decay'd Gentlemen for the <i>Stage</i>,
  complains of the Mismanagement;<span class="leftmar"><i>Annal. Lib 14. cap. 14.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref447"><a href="#side447">[447]</a></sup> And lets us know 'twas the part of
  a Prince to releive their Necessity, and not to Tempt it. And that his Bounty should rather <span

  <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'apon't', corrected by
  Errata">upon't</span>.'</p>

  <p>And in another place, He informs us that 'the German Women were Guarded against danger, and
  kept their Honour out of Harms way, by having no <i>Play-Houses</i> amongst them.'<span
  class="leftmar"><i>De Mor. German. cap. 19</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref448"><a
  href="#side448">[448]</a></sup></p>

  <p><i>Plays</i>, in the Opinion of the Judicious <i>Plutark</i> are dangerous to corrupt Young
  People; And therefore <i>Stage</i> Poetry when it grows too hardy, and Licentious, ought to be
  checkt.<span class="leftmar"><i>Symposiac. Lib. 7.<br/>
  De Audiend. Poet. p. 15. Ed. Par.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref449"><a
  href="#side449">[449]</a></sup> This was the Opinion of these Celebrated <i>Authors</i> with
  respect to <i>Theatres</i>: They Charge them with the Corruption of Principles, and Manners, and
  lay in all imaginable Caution against them. And yet these Men had seldom any thing but this World
  in their Scheme; and form'd their Judgments only upon Natural Light, and Common Experience. We see
  then to what sort of Conduct we are oblig'd. The case is plain; Unless we are little enough to
  renounce our Reason, and fall short of Philosophy, and live <i>under</i> the Pitch of
  <i>Heathenism</i>.</p>

  <p>To these Testimonies I shall add a Couple of <i>Poets</i>, who both seem good Judges of the
  Affair in Hand.</p>

  <p>The first is <i>Ovid</i>, who in his Book <i>De  Arte Amandi</i>, gives his <i>Reader</i> to
  <span class="pagenum" id="page238">{238}</span>understand that the <i>Play-House</i> was the most
  likely Place for him to Forage in. Here would be choice of all sorts: Nothing being more common
  than to see Beauty surpriz'd, Women debauch'd, and Wenches Pick'd up at these Diversions.</p>

  <p>And afterwards relating the imperfect beginning of <i>Plays</i> at the Rape of the
  <i>Sabine</i> Virgins, he adds,</p>

  <p>This <i>Author</i> some time after wrote the <i>Remedy</i> of <i>Love</i>. Here he pretends to
  Prescribe for Prudence, if not for Sobriety. And to this purpose, He forbids the seeing of
  <i>Plays</i>, and the reading of <i>Poets</i>, especially some of them. Such Recreations being apt
  to feed the <i>Distemper</i>, and make the <i>Patient</i> relapse.</p>

  and gives <i>Augustus</i> a sort of <i>Plan</i> for a Publick <i>Reformation</i>. Amongst other
  Things, he advises the suppressing of <i>Plays</i>, as being the promoters of Lewdness, and

  <p>To the Testimony of <i>Ovid</i>, I could add <i>Plautus</i>, <i>Propertius</i>, and
  <i>Juvenal</i>, but being not willing to overburthen the <i>Reader</i>, I shall content my self
  with the <i>Plain-Dealer</i> as one better known at <i>Home</i>.</p>

  <p>This <i>Poet</i> in his <i>Dedication</i> to <i>Lady B</i>, some Eminent <i>Procuress</i>,
  pleads the Merits of his Function, and insists on being Billeted upon <i>free Quarter</i>.

  of both, and is as necessary to such as you, as the Ballad-singer to the Pick-purse, in Convening

  Houses.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Ep. Ded.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref453"><a
  href="#side453">[453]</a></sup> This is franck Evidence, and ne're the less true, for the Air of a
  Jest.</p>

  <p>I shall now in the Second Place proceed to the <i>Censures</i> of the <i>State</i>; And show in
  a few Words how much the <i>Stage</i> stands discouraged by the <i>Laws</i> of other Countrys and
  our own.</p>

  <p>To begin with the <i>Athenians</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>Plut. De Glor.
  Atheniens.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref454"><a href="#side454">[454]</a></sup> This
  People tho' none of the worst Freinds to the <i>Play-House</i> 'thought a <i>Comedy</i> so
  unreputable a Performance, that they made a Law that no Judge of the <i>Ariopagus</i> should make
  one.'</p>

  <p>The <i>Lacedemonians</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Plut. Lacon. Institut.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref455"><a href="#side455">[455]</a></sup> who were remarkable for the Wisdom
  of their <i>Laws</i>, the Sobriety of their <i>Manners</i>, and their Breeding of brave Men. This
  <i>Government</i> would not endure the <i>Stage</i> in any Form, nor under any Regulation.</p>

  <p>To pass on to the <i>Romans</i>. <i>Tully</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Cic. de Repub. Lib. 4.
  cited by, St. Augustine. Libr. 2. de civ. dei. cap. 13.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref456"><a href="#side456">[456]</a></sup> informs us that their <i>Predecessours</i> 'counted
  all <i>Stage-Plays</i> uncreditable and Scandalous. In so much that any <i>Roman</i> who turn'd
  <i>Actor</i> was not only to be Degraded, but likewise as it were disincorporated, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page241">{241}</span>and unnaturalized by the <i>Order</i> of the
  <i>Censors</i>.</p>

  <p>St. <i>Augustine</i> in the same Book,<span class="leftmar"><i>Lib. 2. cap. 29.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref457"><a href="#side457">[457]</a></sup> commends the <i>Romans</i> for
  refusing the <i>Jus Civitatis</i> to <i>Players</i>, for seizing their Freedoms, and making them
  perfectly Foreign to their <i>Government</i>.</p>

  <p>We read in <i>Livy</i><span class="leftmar"><i>Dec. 1. Libr. 7.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref458"><a href="#side458">[458]</a></sup> that the Young People in <i>Rome</i> kept the
  <i>Fabulæ Attellanæ</i> to themselves. 'They would not suffer this Diversion to be blemish'd by
  the <i>Stage</i>. For this reason, as the Historian observes,<span class="leftmar"><i>Ab
  Histrionibus Pollui.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref459"><a
  href="#side459">[459]</a></sup> the <i>Actors</i> of the <i>Fabulæ Atellanæ</i> were neither
  expell'd their <i>Tribe</i>, nor refused to serve in <i>Arms</i>; Both which Penalties it appears
  the <i>Common Players</i> lay under.'</p>

  <p>In the Theodosian <i>Code</i>, <i>Players</i> are call'd <i>Personæ inhonestæ</i>;<span
  class="leftmar"><i>XV. Cod. Theod. Tit. vii. p.375.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref460"><a
  href="#side460">[460]</a></sup> that is, to <i>Translate</i> it softly, Persons Maim'd, and
  Blemish'd in their Reputation. Their <i>Pictures</i> might be seen at the <i>Play-House</i>, but
  were not permitted to hang in any creditable Place<span class="nothand">*</span><span

  href="#side462">[462]</a></sup> by the <i>Civil Law</i>, L. 4. And that those who came upon the
  <i>Stage</i> to divert the people, had a mark of Infamy set upon them. <i>Famosi sunt ex
  Edicto.</i> <span class="leftmar"><i>L. 1. §. 6. de his qui notantur infamia. Gothofred. Ibid. p.

  <p>I shall now come down to our own <i>Constitution</i>. And I find by 39 <i>Eliz. cap. 4. 1. Jac.
  cap. 7</i>. That <span class="pagenum" id="page242">{242}</span><b>all Bearwards, Common Players
  of Enterludes, Counterfeit Egyptians &amp;c. shall be taken, adjudged and deem'd Rogues,
  Vagabonds, and sturdy beggars, and shall sustain all pain and Punishment, as by this Act is in
  that behalf appointed.</b> The <i>Penalties</i> are infamous to the last degree, and
  <i>Capital</i> too, unless they give over. 'Tis true, the first <i>Act</i> excepts those
  <b>Players which belong to a Baron or other Personage of higher Degree, and are authorized to Play
  under the hand and Seal of Armes of such Baron, or Personage</b>. But by the later <i>Statute</i>
  this Privilege of <i>Licensing</i> is taken away: And all of them are expresly brought under the
  Penalty without Distinction.</p>

  <p>About the Year 1580, there was a Petition made to Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> for suppressing of
  <i>Play-Houses</i>. 'Tis somewhat remarkable, and therefore I shall transcribe some part of the
  Relation.</p>

  <p><i>Many Godly Citizens, and other well disposed Gentlemen of</i> London, <i>considering
  that</i> Play-Houses <i>and</i> Dicing-Houses, <i>were Traps for Young Gentlemen and others, and
  perceiving the many Inconveniencies and great damage that would ensue upon the long suffering of
  the same, not only to particular Persons but to the whole City; And that it would also be a great
  disparagement to the Governours, and a dishonour to the Government of this Honourable City, if
  they should <span class="pagenum" id="page243">{243}</span>any longer continue, acquainted some
  Pious Magistrates therewith, desiring them to take some Course for the suppression of Common</i>
  Play-Houses, <i>&amp;c. within the City of</i> London <i>and Liberties thereof; who thereupon made
  humble suit to Queen</i> Elizabeth <i>and her Privy Council, and obtain'd leave of her Majesty to
  thrust the Players out of the City and to pull down all</i> Play-Houses, <i>and</i> Dicing-Houses
  <i>within their Liberties, which accordingly was effected.<span class="leftmar"><i>Rawlidge his
  Monster, lately found out, &amp;c. p. 2, 3, 4.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref464"><a
  href="#side464">[464]</a></sup> And the Play-Houses in</i> Grace-Church-street <i>&amp;c. were
  quite put down and suppress'd</i>.</p>

  <p>I shall give a Modern Instance or two from <i>France</i> and so conclude these Authorities.</p>

  <p>In the Year 1696. we are inform'd by a Dutch <i>Print</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Gazett
  Roterdam: Dec. 20. Paris.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref465"><a

  'support'd by the interest of some Religious Persons at Court, has done his utmost to suppress the
  <i>Publick Theatres</i> by degrees; or at least to clear them of Profaness.'</p>

  <p>And last Summer the <i>Gazetts</i> in the <i>Paris Article</i> affirm.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>French Amsterdam Harlem Gazetts. Paris, May. 17th. 1697.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref466"><a href="#side466">[466]</a></sup> That the King has 'order'd the

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page244">{244}</span></div>

  <p>The same <i>Intelligence</i> the next week after, acquaints us, 'that some Persons of the first
  <i>Quality</i> at Court, who were the Protectors of these <i>Comedians</i>, had solicited the
  French King to recal his <i>Order</i> against them, but their Request had no success.'</p>

  <p class="sp5">And here to put an end to the Modern Authorities, I shall subjoyn a sort of
  <i>Pastoral Letter</i> publish'd about two years since by the Bishop of <i>Arras</i> in
  <i>Flanders</i>. The <i>Reader</i> shall have as much of it as concerns him in both Languages.</p>

  infame &amp; scandaleux, elle les prive publiquement des Sacremens &amp; n'oublie rien pour
  marquer en toutes rencountres son aversion pour cet ètat &amp; pour l'inspirer a ses Enfans. Des
  Rituels de Dioceses tres reglés les mettent au nombre des personnes que les Curés sont obligés de
  traiter comme excommunies; Celui de Paris les joint aux Sorciers, &amp; aux Magiciens, &amp; les

  Religion, not to know the great disgust it has always declar'd, for <i>Publick Sights</i>, and for
  <i>Plays</i> in particular. The Holy <i>Fathers</i> condemn them in their writings; They look upon
  them as reliques of Heathenism, and Schools of Debauchery. They have been always abominated by the
  Church; And notwithstanding those who are concern'd in this Scandalous Profession; are not
  absolutely expell'd by a Formal Excommunication, yet She publickly refuses them the Sacraments,
  and omits nothing upon all occasions, to show her aversion for this Employment, and to transfuse
  <span class="pagenum" id="page248">{248}</span>the same sentiments into her Children. The
  <i>Rituals</i> of the best govern'd Dioceses, have ranged the <i>Players</i> among those whom the
  Parish Priests are oblig'd to treat as Excommunicated Persons. The <i>Ritual</i> of <i>Paris</i>
  joyns them with Sorcerers, and Magicians, and looks upon them as notoriously infamous; The most
  eminent Bishops for Piety, have publickly denied them the Sacraments: For this reason, we our
  selves have known one of the most considerable Bishops in <i>France</i>, turn back a <i>Player</i>
  that came to be Married; And an other of the same order, refused to bury them in Consecrated
  Ground. And by the <i>Orders</i> of a Bishop, who is much more illustrious for his worth, for his
  Piety, and the Strictness of his Life, than for the <i>Purple</i> in his Habit; They are thrown
  amongst Fornicators, Usurers, Blasphemers, Lewd Women, and declar'd Excommunicates, amongst the
  Infamous, and Simoniacal, and other Scandalous Persons who are in the List of those who ought
  publickly to be barr'd Communion.</p>

  <p>'Unless therfore we have a mind to condemn the Church, the Holy Fathers, and the most holy
  Bishops, 'tis impossible to justifie <i>Plays</i>; neither is the Defence of those less
  impracticable, who <span class="pagenum" id="page249">{249}</span>by their Countenance of these
  Diversions, not only have their share of the Mischief there done, but contribute at the same time
  to fix these unhappy Ministers of Satan in a Profession, which by depriving them of the Sacraments
  of the Church, leaves them under a constant necessity of Sinning, and out of all hopes of being
  saved, unless they give it over.&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>From the general Unlawfulness of <i>Plays</i>, the Bishop proceeds to argue more strongly
  against seeing them at times which are more particularly devoted to Piety, and Humiliation: And
  therefore he strickly forbids his Diocess the <i>Play-House</i> in <i>Advent</i>, <i>Lent</i>, or
  under any publick <i>Calamity</i>. And at last concludes in this Manner.</p>

  <p>'As for the Case of <i>Players</i> both Men, and Women, we expresly forbid all our Rectors,
  Pastors, and Confessours, to admit them to the Sacraments, unless they shall repent them of their
  Crime, make proof of their Reformation, renounce their <i>Business</i>, and retrieve the Scandal
  they have given, by such publick Satisfaction as we shall think proper to injoyn them. Made and
  Decreed at <i>Arras</i> the fourth day of <i>December 1695.</i></p>

  <p>I shall now in the Third Place, give a short account of the sense of the <i>Primitive</i>
  Church concerning the <i>Stage</i>: And first I shall instance in her <i>Councils</i>.</p>

  <p>The Council of <i>Illiberis</i>, or <i>Collioure</i> in <i>Spain</i>, decrees,<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ann. 305.</i> <i>Can. 67.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref468"><a
  href="#side468">[468]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'That it shall not be lawful for any Woman who is either in full Communion or a probationer for
  Baptism, to Marry, or Entertain any <i>Comedians</i> or <i>Actors</i>; whoever takes this Liberty
  shall be Excommunicated.'</p>

  <p>The first Council of <i>Arles</i>, runs thus,<span class="leftmar"><i>Ann. 314. Can.
  5.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref469"><a href="#side469">[469]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'Concerning <i>Players</i>, we have thought fit to Excommunicate them as long as they continue
  to <i>Act</i>.'</p>

  <p>The Second Council of <i>Arles</i> made their <i>20th</i> Canon to the same purpose, and almost
  in the same words.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ann. 452.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref470"><a href="#side470">[470]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The Third Council of <i>Carthage</i>, of which St. <i>Augustine</i> was a Member, ordains,<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ann. 397. Can. 11.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref471"><a
  href="#side471">[471]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'That the Sons of Bishops, or other Clergy-men should not be permitted to furnish out Publick
  <i>Shews</i>, or <i>Plays</i><span class="nothand">*</span><span class="leftmar">* <i>Secularia
  spectacula, which manifestly comprehends the Stage.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref472"><a
  href="#side472">[472]</a></sup> or be present at them: Such sort of Pagan <i>Entertainments</i>
  being forbidden all the <i>Laity</i>. It being always unlawful for all Christians to come amongst
  <i>Blasphemers</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page251">{251}</span></div>

  <p>This last branch shews the <i>Canon</i> was Principally levell'd against the <i>Play-House</i>:
  And the reason of the Prohibition, holds every jot as strong against the <i>English</i>, as
  against the <i>Roman Stage</i>.</p>

  <p>By the 35th <i>Canon</i> of this <i>Council</i> 'tis decreed,</p>

  <p>'That <i>Actors</i> or others belonging to the <i>Stage</i>, who are either <i>Converts</i>, or
  <i>Penitents</i> upon a Relapse, shall not be denied Admission into the Church.' This is farther
  proof, that <i>Players</i> as long as they kept to their Employment were bar'd
  <i>Communion</i>.</p>

  <p>Another <i>African Council</i> declares,<span class="leftmar"><i>Ann. 424. Can.
  96</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref473"><a href="#side473">[473]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'That the Testimony of People of ill Reputation, of <i>Players</i>, and others of such
  scandalous Employments, shall not be admitted against any Person.'</p>

  <p>The Second <i>Council</i> of <i>Chaalon</i> sets forth,<span class="leftmar"><i>Concil.
  Cabilon. Ann. 813. Can. 9.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref474"><a
  href="#side474">[474]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'That Clergy men ought to abstain from all over-engaging Entertainments in Musick or
  <i>Show</i>. (<i>oculorum auriumque illecebris</i>.) And as for the smutty, and Licentious
  Insolence of <i>Players</i>, and Buffoons, let them not only decline the Hearing it themselves,
  but likewise conclude the <i>Laity</i> oblig'd to the same Conduct.</p>

  <p class="sp4">I could cite many more Authorities of this Kind, but being conscious of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page252">{252}</span>Niceness of the <i>Age</i>, I shall forbear, and proceed
  to the Testimony of the <i>Fathers</i>.</p>

  <p>To begin with <i>Theophilus</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, who lived in the Second
  <i>Century</i>.</p>

  <p>''Tis not lawful (says he)<span class="leftmar"><i>Libr. 3. ad Autol.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref475"><a href="#side475">[475]</a></sup> for us to be present at the
  <i>Prizes</i> or your <i>Gladiators</i>, least by this means we should be <i>Accessaries</i> to
  the Murthers there committed. Neither dare we presume upon the Liberty of your other
  <i>Shews</i>,<span class="nothand">*</span><span class="leftmar">* <i>Spectacula.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref476"><a href="#side476">[476]</a></sup> least our Senses should be
  tinctur'd, and disoblig'd, with Indecency, and Profaness. The Tragical Distractions of
  <i>Tereus</i> and <i>Thyestes</i>, are Nonsense to us. We are for seeing no Representations of
  Lewdness. The Stage-Adulteries of the <i>Gods</i>, and <i>Hero's</i>, are unwarrantable
  Entertainments: And so much the worse, because the Mercenary <i>Players</i> set them off with all
  the Charms and Advantages of Speaking. God forbid that <i>Christians</i> who are remarkable for
  Modesty, and Reserv'dness; who are obliged to Discipline, and train'd up in Virtue, God forbid I
  say, that we should dishonour our Thoughts, much less our Practise, with such Wickedness as
  This!'</p>

  <p><i>Tertullian</i> who liv'd at the latter end of this Century is copious upon this subject; I
  shall translate but some Part of <span class="pagenum" id="page253">{253}</span>it. In his
  Apologetick, He thus addresses the Heathens.<span class="leftmar"><i>Chap. 38.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref477"><a href="#side477">[477]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'We keep off from your publick <i>Shews</i>, because we can't understand the Warrant of their
  Original. There's Superstition and Idolatry in the Case: And we dislike the Entertainment because
  we dislike the reason of its Institution. Besides, We have nothing to do with the Frensies of the
  <i>Race-Ground</i>, the Lewdness of the <i>Play-House</i>, or the Barbarities of the
  <i>Bear-Garden</i>. The <i>Epicureans</i> had the Liberty to state the Notion, and determine the
  Object of Pleasure. Why can't we have the same Privilege? What Offence is it then if we differ
  from you in the Idea of Satisfaction? If we won't understand to brighten our Humour, and live
  pleasantly, where's the harm? If any body has the worst on't, 'tis only our selves.'</p>

  <p>His Book <i>de Spectaculis</i> was wrote on purpose to diswade the Christians, from the publick
  Diversions of the <i>Heathens</i>, of which the <i>Play-House</i> was one. In his first Chapter He
  gives them to understand, 'That the Tenour of their Faith, the Reason of Principle, and the Order
  of Discipline, had bar'd them the Entertainments of the <i>Town</i>. And therefore He exhorts them
  to refresh their <span class="pagenum" id="page254">{254}</span>Memories, to run up to their
  Baptism, and recollect their first Engagements. For without care, Pleasure is a strange bewitching
  Thing. When it gets the Ascendant, 'twill keep on Ignorance for an Excuse of Liberty, make a man's
  Conscience wink, and suborn his Reason against himself.</p>

  <p>'But as he goes on,<span class="leftmar"><i>Chap. 3.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref478"><a href="#side478">[478]</a></sup> some peoples Faith is either too full of Scruples,
  or too barren of Sense. Nothing will serve to settle them but a plain Text of <i>Scripture</i>.
  They hover in uncertainty because 'tis not said as expresly thou shalt not go to the
  <i>Play-House</i>, as 'tis thou shalt not Kill. But this looks more like Fencing than Argument.
  For we have the Meaning of the prohibition tho' not the sound, in the first <i>Psalm. Blessed is
  the Man that walks not in the Council of the Ungodly, nor stands in the way of Sinners, nor sits
  in the Seat of the Scornful.</i></p>

  <p>'The <i>Censors</i> whose business 'twas to take care of Regularity and Manners,<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. Cap. 10.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref479"><a
  href="#side479">[479]</a></sup> look'd on these <i>Play-Houses</i> as no other than
  <i>Batteries</i> upon Virtue and Sobriety, and for this reason often pull'd them down before they
  were well built, so that here we can argue from the <i>Precedents</i> of meer <i>Nature</i>, and
  plead the <i>Heathens</i> against themselves. Upon this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page255">{255}</span>view <i>Pompey</i> the Great, when he built his <i>Dramatick</i>
  Bawdy-House, clapp'd a <i>Chappel</i> a Top on't. He would not let it go under the Name of a
  Play-House, but conven'd the people to a Solemn Dedication, and called it <i>Venus's</i> Temple;
  Giving them to understand at the same time that there were <i>Benches</i> under it for Diversion.
  He was afraid if he had not gone this way to work, The <i>Censors</i> might afterwards have razed
  the Monument, and branded his Memory. Thus a Scandalous pile of Building was protected: The
  Temple, cover'd the <i>Play-House</i>, and Discipline was baffled by <i>Superstition</i>. But the
  Design is notably suited to the Patronage of <i>Bacchus</i><span class="nothand">*</span><span
  class="leftmar">* <i>The Play-houses were dedicated to Bacchus.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref480"><a href="#side480">[480]</a></sup> and <i>Venus</i>. These two Confederate Devils of
  Lust and Intemperance, do well together. The very Functions of the <i>Players</i> resemble their
  <i>Protectors</i>, and are instances of Service and Acknowledgment. Their Motion is effeminate,
  and their Gestures vitious and Significant: And thus they worship the Luxury of one <i>Idoll</i>,
  and the Lewdness of the other.</p>

  <p>'And granting the Regards of Quality, the Advantages of Age, or Temper, may fortifie some
  People;<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap. 15.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref481"><a
  href="#side481">[481]</a></sup> granting Modesty secur'd, and the Diversion as it were refin'd by
  this Means: Yet a Man <span class="pagenum" id="page256">{256}</span>must not expect to stand by
  perfectly unmoved, and impregnable. No body can be pleas'd without Sensible Impressions. Nor can
  such Perceptions be received without a Train of Passions attending them. These Consequences will
  be sure to work back upon their Causes, solicite the Fancy, and heighten the Original Pleasure.
  But if a Man pretends to be a <i>Stoick</i> at <i>Plays</i>, he falls under another Imputation.
  For where there is no Impression, there can be no Pleasure: And then the <i>Spectator</i> is very
  much Impertinent, in going where he gets nothing for his Pains. And if this were all; I suppose
  Christians have something else to do than to ramble about to no purpose.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap. 22.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref482"><a
  href="#side482">[482]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'Even those very Magistrates who abet the <i>Stage</i>, discountenance the <i>Players</i>. They
  stigmatize their <i>Character</i>, and cramp their Freedoms. The whole Tribe of them is thrown out
  of all Honour and Privilege. They are neither suffer'd to be Lords, nor Gentlemen: To come within
  the <i>Senate</i>, or harangue the People, or so much as to be Members of a <i>Common-Council</i>.
  Now what Caprice and Inconsistency is this! To love what we punish, and lessen those whom we
  admire! To cry up the Mystery, and <span class="pagenum" id="page257">{257}</span>censure the
  practise; For a Man to be as it were eclips'd upon the score of Merit is certainly an odd sort of
  Justice! True. But the Inference lies stronger another way. What a Confession then is this of an
  Ill Business; when the very Excellency of it is not without Infamy?</p>

  <p>'Since therefore Humane Prudence has thought fit to degrade the <i>Stage</i>, notwithstanding
  the Divertingness of it. Since Pleasure can't make them an Interest Here, nor shelter them from
  Censure.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap. 23.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref483"><a
  href="#side483">[483]</a></sup> How will They be able to stand the shock of Divine Justice, and
  what <i>Reckoning</i> have they <i>Reason</i> to expect Hereafter?</p>

  <p>'All things consider'd 'tis no wonder such People should fall under <i>Possession</i>. God
  knows we have had a sad Example of this already. A certain Woman went to the <i>Play-House</i>,
  and brought the Devil Home with Her.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap. 26.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref484"><a href="#side484">[484]</a></sup> And when the Unclean Spirit was
  press'd in the <i>Exorcism</i> and ask'd how he durst attack a Christian. I have done nothing
  (says he) but what I can justify. For I seiz'd her upon my own Ground. Indeed, how many Instances
  have we of others who have apostatiz'd from God, by <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'Correspondence',
  corrected by Errata">this Correspondence</span> with the Devil? What <i>Communion has Light with
  Darkness? No Man can serve <span class="pagenum" id="page258">{258}</span>two Masters</i>, nor
  have Life and Death in him at the same time.</p>

  <p>'Will you not then avoid this Seat of Infection?<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap.
  27.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref485"><a href="#side485">[485]</a></sup> The very Air
  suffers by their Impurities; And they almost Pronounce the Plague. What tho' the performance may
  be in some measure pretty and entertaining? What tho' Innocence, yes and Virtue too, shines
  through some part of it? 'Tis not the custom to prepare Poyson unpalatable, nor make up Ratzbane
  with Rhubarb and Sena. No. To have the Mischief speed, they must oblige the Sense, and make the
  Dose pleasant. Thus the Devil throws in a Cordial Drop to make the Draught go down; And steals
  some few Ingredients from the <i>Dispensatory</i> of Heaven. In short, look upon all the engaging
  Sentences of the Stage; Their flights of Fortitude, and Philosophy, the Loftiness of their Stile,
  the Musick of the Cadence, and the Finess of the Conduct; Look upon it only I say as Honey
  dropping from the Bowels of a Toad, or the Bag of a Spider: Let your Health over-rule your
  Pleasure, and don't die of a little <i>Liquorishness</i>.</p>

  <p>'In earnest Christian, our time for Entertainment is not yet:<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid.
  cap. 28.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref486"><a href="#side486">[486]</a></sup> you are
  two craving and ill managed if you are so violent <span class="pagenum"
  id="page259">{259}</span>for Delight. And let me tell you, no wiser than you should be, if you
  count such Things Satisfaction. Some Philosophers placed their Happiness in bare Tranquillity.
  Easiness of Thought, and Absence of Pain, was all they aim'd at. But this it seems won't Satisfie
  Thee. Thou liest sighing and hankering after the <i>Play-house</i>. Prethee recollect thy self:
  Thou knowest Death ought to be our Pleasure, And therefore I hope Life may be a little without it.
  Are not our Desires the same with the Apostles, <i>To be Dissolv'd and to be with Christ</i>. Let
  us act up to our pretentions, and let Pleasure be true to Inclination.</p>

  <p>'But if you can't wait for Delight; if you must be put into present Possession, wee'l cast the
  Cause upon that Issue.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap. 29.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref487"><a href="#side487">[487]</a></sup> Now were you not unreasonable, you would perceive
  the Liberalities of Providence, and find your self almost in the midst of Satisfaction. For what
  can be more transporting than the Friendship of Heaven, and the Discovery of Truth, than the Sense
  of our Mistakes, and the Pardon of our Sins? What greater Pleasure can there be, than to scorn
  being <i>Pleas'd</i>? To contemn the World? And to be a Slave to Nothing? 'Tis a mighty
  satisfaction I take it, to have a clear Conscience;</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page260">{260}</span></div>

  <p>To make Life no Burthen, nor Death any Terror! To trample upon the <i>Pagan</i> Deities; To
  batter <i>Principalities</i> and <i>Powers</i>, and force the Devils to Resign!<span
  class="nothand">*</span><span class="leftmar">* <i>By Exorcisms</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref488"><a href="#side488">[488]</a></sup> These are the Delights, these are the noble
  Entertainments of Christians: And besides the advantage of the Quality, they are always at hand,
  and cost us nothing.'</p>

  <p><i>Clemens</i> <i>Alexandrinus</i> affirms<span class="leftmar"><i>Lib. 3. Pædag. Ann. 204.
  cap. 11.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref489"><a href="#side489">[489]</a></sup> 'That the
  <i>Circus</i> and <i>Theatre</i> may not improperly be call'd the <i>Chair</i> of
  <i>Pestilence</i>.&mdash;&mdash;Away then with these Lewd, Ungodly Diversions, and which are but
  Impertinence at the Best. What part of Impudence either in words or practise, is omitted by the
  Stage? Don't the Buffoons take almost all manner of Liberties, and plunge through Thick and Thin,
  to make a jest? Now those who are affected with a vitious satisfaction, will be haunted with the
  Idea, and spread the Infection. But if a man is not entertain'd to what purpose should he go
  Thither? Why should he be fond where he finds nothing, and court that which sleeps upon the Sense?
  If 'tis said these Diversions are taken only to unbend the Mind, and refresh Nature a little. To
  this I answer. That the spaces between Business should not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page261">{261}</span>be fill'd up with such Rubbish. A wise man has a Guard upon his
  Recreations, and always prefers, the Profitable to the Pleasant.'</p>

  <p><i>Minutius Felix</i> delivers his Sense in these Words:<span class="leftmar"><i>Ann.
  206.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref490"><a href="#side490">[490]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'As for us, who rate our Degree by our Virtue, and value our selves more upon our Lives, than
  our Fortunes; we decline your Pompous <i>Shews</i>, and publick Entertainments. And good Reason we
  have for our Aversion. These Things have their Rise from Idols, and are the Train of a false
  Religion. The Pleasure is ill Descended, and likewise Vitious and ensnaring. For who can do less
  than abominate, the Clamorous Disorders of the <i>Race-Ground</i>, and the profession of Murther
  at the <i>Prize</i>. And for the <i>Stage</i>, there you have more Lewdness, tho' not a jot less
  of Distraction. Sometimes your <i>Mimicks</i>, are so Scandalous and Expressing, that 'tis almost
  hard to distinguish between the <i>Fact</i> and the <i>Representation</i>. Sometimes a Luscious
  <i>Actor</i> shall whine you into Love, and give the Disease that he Counterfeits.'</p>

  <p>St. <i>Cyprian</i> or the Author <i>de Spectaculis</i>, will furnish us farther.</p>

  <p>Here this Father argues against those who thought the <i>Play-House</i> no unlawful <span
  class="pagenum" id="page262">{262}</span>Diversion, because 'twas not Condemn'd by express
  <i>Scripture</i>. 'Let meer Modesty (says he) supply the <i>Holy Text</i>: And let <i>Nature</i>
  govern where <i>Revelation</i> does not reach. Some Things are too black to lie upon <i>Paper</i>,
  and are more strongly forbidden, because unmention'd. The Divine Wisdom must have had a low
  Opinion of <i>Christians</i>, had it descended to particulars in this Case. Silence is sometimes
  the best Method for Authority. To Forbid often puts People in mind of what they should not do; And
  thus the force of the Precept is lost by naming the Crime. Besides, what need we any farther
  Instruction? Discipline and general Restraint makes up the Meaning of the Law; and common Reason
  will tell you what the Scripture has left unsaid. I would have every one examine his own Thoughts,
  and inquire at Home into the Duties of his Profession. This is a good way to secure him from
  Indecency. For those Rules which a Man has work'd out for himself he commonly makes most use
  of.'&mdash;&mdash;And after having describ'd the infamous Diversions of the <i>Play-house</i>; He
  expostulates in this Manner.</p>

  <p>'What business has a Christian at such Places as these? A Christian who has not <span
  class="pagenum" id="page263">{263}</span>the Liberty so much as to think of an ill Thing. Why does
  he entertain himself with Lewd Representations? Has he a mind to discharge his Modesty, and be
  flesh'd for the <i>Practise</i>? Yes. this is the Consequence. By using to see these Things, hee'l
  learn to do them.&mdash;&mdash;What need I mention the Levities, and Impertinence in
  <i>Comedies</i>, or the ranting Distractions of <i>Tragedy</i>? Were these Things unconcern'd with
  Idolatry, Christians ought not to be at them. For were they not highly Criminal, the Foolery of
  them is egregious, and unbecoming the Gravity of <i>Beleivers</i>.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>'As I have often said these Foppish, these pernicious Diversions, must be avoided. We must set
  a Guard upon our Senses, and keep the Sentinal always upon Duty. To make Vice familiar to the ear,
  is the way to recommend it. And since the mind of Man has a Natural Bent to Extravagance; how is
  it likely to hold out under Example, and Invitation? If you push that which totters already,
  whether will it tumble? In earnest, we must draw off our Inclinations from these Vanities. A
  Christian has much better <i>Sights</i> than these to look at. He has solid Satisfactions in his
  <span class="pagenum" id="page264">{264}</span>Power, which will please, and improve him at the
  same time.</p>

  <p>'Would a Christian be agreeably Refresh'd? Let him read the <i>Scriptures</i>: Here the
  Entertainment will suit his Character, and be big enough for his Quality.&mdash;Beloved, how
  noble, how moving how profitable a pleasure is it to be thus employed? To have our Expectations
  always in prospect, and be intent on the Glories of Heaven?'</p>

  <p>He has a great deal more upon this Subject in his <i>Epistles</i> to <i>Donatus</i> and
  <i>Eucratius</i>, which are undoubtedly genuine. The later being somewhat remarkable, I shall
  Translate part of it for the <i>Reader</i>. <span class="leftmar"><i>Ad Eucrat.</i></span><sup

  <p>'Dear Brother, your usual Kindness, together with your desire of releiving your own Modesty and
  mine, has put you upon asking my Thoughts concerning a certain <i>Player</i> in your
  Neighbourhood; whether such a Person ought to be allow'd the Privilege of <i>Communion</i>. This
  Man it seems continues in his Scandalous Profession, and keeps a Nursery under him. He teaches
  that which 'twas a Crime in him to learn, sets up for a Master of Debauch, and Propagates the lewd
  Mystery. The case standing thus, 'tis my Opinion that the Admission of such a <i>Member</i> would
  be a Breach of the <span class="pagenum" id="page265">{265}</span>Discipline of the Gospel, and a
  Presumption upon the Divine Majesty: Neither do I think it fit the Honour of the Church should
  suffer by so Infamous a Correspondence.'</p>

  <p><i>Lactantius</i>'s Testimony shall come next. This Author in his <i>Divine
  Institutions</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>Lib. 6. cap. 20.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref492"><a href="#side492">[492]</a></sup> which he Dedicates to <i>Constantine</i> the Great,
  cautions the Christians against the <i>Play-House</i>, from the Disorder, and danger of those
  places. For as he observes.</p>

  <p>'The debauching of Virgins, and the Amours of Strumpets, are the Subject of <i>Comedy</i>. And
  here the Rule is, the more Rhetorick the more Mischeif, and the best <i>Poets</i> are the worst
  Common-Wealths-men. For the Harmony and Ornament of the Composition serves only to recommend the
  Argument, to fortifie the Charm, and engage the Memory. At last he concludes with this advice.</p>

  <p>'Let us avoid therefore these Diversions, least somewhat of the Malignity should seize us. Our
  Minds should be quiet and Compos'd, and not over-run with Amusements. Besides a Habit of Pleasure
  is an ensnaring Circumstance. 'Tis apt to make us forget God, and grow cool in the Offices of
  Virtue.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap. 21.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref493"><a

  <p>'Should a Man have a Stage at Home, would not his Reputation suffer extreamly, and all people
  count him a notorious Libertine? most undoubtedly. Now the Place does not alter the Property. The
  Practise at the <i>Play-House</i> is the same thing, only there he has more Company to keep him in
  Countenance.</p>

  <p>'A well work'd <i>Poem</i> is a powerful piece of Imposture: It masters the Fancy, and hurries
  it no Body knows whither.&mdash;&mdash;If therefore we would be govern'd by Reason let us stand
  off from the Temptation, such Pleasures can have no good Meaning. Like delicious Morsels they
  subdue the Palate, and flatter us only to cut our Throats. Let us prefer Reality to Appearance,
  Service, to Show; and Eternity to Time.<span class="leftmar"><i>Ibid. cap. 22.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref494"><a href="#side494">[494]</a></sup></p>

  <p>'As God makes Virtue the Condition of Glory, and trains men up to Happiness by Hardship and
  Industry. So the Devils road to Destruction lies through Sensuality and <i>Epicurism</i>. And as
  pretended Evils lead us on to uncounterfeited Bliss; So Visionary Satisfactions are the causes of
  Real Misery. In short, These Inviting Things are all stratagem. Let us, take care the softness and
  Importunity of the Pleasure does not surprise us, nor the Bait bring <span class="pagenum"
  id="page267">{267}</span>us within the snare. The Senses are more than <i>Out-Works</i>, and
  should be defended accordingly.'</p>

  <p>I shall pass over St. <i>Ambrose</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>In Psal. 119.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref495"><a href="#side495">[495]</a></sup> and go on to St.
  <i>Chrisostome</i>. This <i>Father</i> is copious upon the Subject, I could translate some
  <i>Sheets</i> from him were it necessary. But length being not my Business, a few Lines may serve
  to discover his Opinion. His <i>15 Homily ad Populum Antiochenum</i>, runs thus.</p>

  <p>'Most People fancy the Unlawfulness of going to <i>Plays</i> is not clear. But by their favour,
  a world of Disorders are the Consequences of such a Liberty. For frequenting the <i>Play-House</i>
  has brought Whoring and Ribaldry into Vogue, and finish'd all the parts of Debauchery.'</p>

  <p>Afterwards he seems to make the supposition better than the <i>Fact</i>, and argues upon a
  feign'd Case.</p>

  <p>'Let us not only avoid downright Sinning, but the Tendencies to it. Some Indifferent Things are
  fatal in the Consequence, and strike us at the Rebound. Now who would chuse his standing within an
  Inch of a Fall; or swim upon the Verge of a Whirlpool? He that walks upon a Precipice, shakes tho'
  he does not tumble. And commonly his Concern brings him to the Bottom. The Case is much <span
  class="pagenum" id="page268">{268}</span>the same in reference to Conscience, and Morality. He
  that won't keep his Distance from the Gulph, is oftentimes suck'd in by the Eddy; and the least
  oversight is enough to undo Him.'</p>

  <p>In his 37 Homily upon the Eleventh Chapter of St. <i>Matthew</i> he declaims more at large
  against the Stage.</p>

  <p>'Smutty Songs (says he) are much more abominable than Stench and Ordure. And which is most to
  be lamented, you are not at all uneasy at such Licentiousness. You Laugh when you should Frown;
  and Commend what you ought to abhor.&mdash;&mdash;Heark you, you can keep the Language of your own
  House in order: If your Servants or your Childrens Tongues run Riot, they presently smart for't.
  And yet at the <i>Play-House</i> you are quite another Thing. These little Buffoons have a strange
  Ascendant! A luscious Sentence is hugely welcome from their Mouth: And instead of Censure, they
  have thanks and encouragement for their Pains. Now if a Man would be so just as to wonder at
  himself, here's Madness, and Contradiction in Abundance.</p>

  <p>'But I know you'l say what's this to me, I neither sing nor pronounce, any of this Lewd stuff?
  Granting your Plea, <span class="pagenum" id="page269">{269}</span>what do you get by't? If you
  don't repeat these Scurrilities, you are very willing to hear them. Now whether the Ear, or the
  Tongue is mismanaged, comes much to the same reckoning. The difference of the <i>Organ</i>, does
  not alter the Action so mightily, as you may imagine. But pray how do you prove you don't repeat
  them? They may be your Discourse, or the Entertainments of your Closet for ought we know to the
  contrary. This is certain; you hear them with pleasure in your Face, and make it your business to
  run after them: And to my Mind, these are strong Arguments of your Approbation.</p>

  <p>'I desire to ask you a Question. Suppose you hear any wretches Blaspheme, are you in any
  Rapture about it? And do your Gestures appear airy, and obliged? Far from it. I doubt not but your
  blood grows chill, and your Ears are stopt at the Presumption. And what's the Reason of this
  Aversion in your Behaviour? Why 'tis because you don't use to Blaspheme, your self. Pray clear
  your self the same way from the Charge of Obscenity. Wee'l then believe you don't talk Smut, when
  we percieve you careful not to hear it. Lewd Sonnets, and Serenades are quite different from the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page270">{270}</span>Prescriptions of Virtue. This is strange
  Nourishment for a Christian to take in! I don't wonder you should lose your Health, when you feed
  thus Foul. It may be Chastity is no such easy Task! Innocence moves upon an Ascent, at least for
  sometime. Now those who are always Laughing can never strain up Hill. If the best preparations of
  Care will just do, what must become of those that are dissolv'd in Pleasure, and lie under the
  Instructions of Debauchery?&mdash;&mdash;Have you not heard how that St. <i>Paul</i> exhorts us
  <i>to rejoyce in the Lord</i>? He said <i>in the Lord</i>; not in the Devil. But alas! what
  leisure have you to Mind St. <i>Paul</i>? How should you be sensible of your Faults, when your
  Head is always kept Hot, and as it were intoxicated with Buffooning?'&mdash;&mdash;
  &mdash;&mdash;He goes on, and lashes the Impudence of the <i>Stage</i> with a great deal of Satir
  and Severity; and at last proposes this Objection.</p>

  <p>'You'l say, I can give you many Instances where the <i>Play-House</i> has done no Harm. Don't
  mistake. Throwing away of Time and ill example, has a great deal of Harm in't; And thus far you
  are guilty at the best. For granting your own Virtue impenetrable, and out of Reach, Granting the
  Protection of your Temper has brought you off unhurt, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page271">{271}</span>are all People thus Fortified? By no means. However, many a weak Brother
  has ventur'd after you, and miscarried upon your <i>Precedent</i>. And since you make others thus
  <i>Faulty</i>, how can you be <i>Innocent</i> your self? All the People undone There, will lay
  their Ruine at your Door. The Company are all Accessary to the Mischeif of the Place. For were
  there no <i>Audience</i>, we should have no <i>Acting</i>. And therefore those who joyn in the
  Crime, will ne're be parted in the Punishment. Granting your Modesty has secur'd you, which by the
  way I believe nothing of; yet since many have been debauch'd by the <i>Play-House</i>, you must
  expect a severe Reckning for giving them Encouragement. Tho' after all, as Virtuous as you are, I
  doubt not, you wou'd have been much Better, had you kept away.</p>

  <p>'In fine, Let us not dispute to no purpose; The practise won't bear a Defence! Where the Cause
  is naught 'tis in vain to rack our Reason, and strain for Pretences. The best excuse for what is
  past, is to stand clear from the danger, and do so no more.'</p>

  <p>One citation more from St. <i>Chrysostom</i>, and I take Leave. In the Preface of his
  Commentary upon St. <i>John</i>'s Gospel speaking of <i>Plays</i> and other Publick <i>Shews</i>,
  he has these words.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page272">{272}</span></div>

  <p>'But what need I branch out the Lewdness of those <i>Spectacles</i>, and be particular in
  Description? For what's there to be met with but Lewd Laughing, but Smut, Railing, and Buffoonry?
  In a word. 'Tis all Scandal and Confusion. Observe me, I speak to you all; Let none who partake of
  this <i>Holy-Table</i>, unqualifie <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'himself', corrected by
  Errata">themselves</span> with such Mortal Diversions.'</p>

  <p>St. <i>Hierom</i> on the <i>1st</i>. Verse 32 <i>Psal.</i> makes this Exposition upon the
  <i>Text</i>.</p>

  <p>'Some are delighted with the Satisfactions of this World, some with the <i>Circus</i>, and some
  with the <i>Theatre</i>: But the Psalmist commands every good Man <i>to delight himself in the
  Lord</i>.&mdash;&mdash;For as <i>Isaiah</i> speaks, <i>woe to them that put bitter for sweet, and
  sweet for bitter</i>.' And in his Epistles<span class="leftmar"><i>Ep. 9. 12. Advers. Jovinian.
  Lib. 2. cap. 7.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref496"><a href="#side496">[496]</a></sup> he
  cautions the Ladies against having any thing to do with the <i>Play-House</i>, against Lewd Songs,
  and Ill Conversation. Because they set ill Humours at work, Caress the Fancy, and make pleasure a
  Conveyance for Destruction.'</p>

  <p>In the <i>6th.</i> Book of his Comentary on <i>Ezechiel</i> he lets us understand;<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Chap. 20.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref497"><a
  href="#side497">[497]</a></sup> 'That when we depart out of <i>Ægypt</i> we must refine our
  Inclinations, and change our Delights into Aversion. And after some other Instances, He tells us
  we must <span class="pagenum" id="page273">{273}</span>decline the <i>Theatres</i>, and all other
  dangerous Diversions, which stain the Innocence of the Soul, and slip into the <i>Will</i> through
  the Senses.'</p>

  <p>St. <i>Augustine</i> in his <i>5th</i>. Epistle to <i>Marcellinus</i> will afford us something
  upon the same Argument.</p>

  <p>'The prosperity of Sinners is their greatest Unhappiness. If one may say so, They are most
  Punish'd when they are overlook'd. By this means their bad Temper is encourag'd, and they are more
  inclin'd to be false to themselves; And we know an Enemy <i>within</i>, is more dangerous than one
  <i>without</i>. But the perverse Reasonings of the Generality, make different Conclusions. They
  fancy the World goes wonderfully well when People make a Figure. When a Man is a Prince in his
  Fortune, but a Begger in his Vertue; Has a great many fine Things about him, but not so much as
  one good Quality to deserve them. When the <i>Play-Houses</i> go up, and Religion go's down. When
  Prodigality is admir'd, and Charity laugh'd at. When the <i>Players</i> can revel with the Rich
  Man's purse, And the Poor have scarse enough to keep Life and Soul together.&mdash;&mdash;When God
  suffers these Things to flourish, we may be sure he is most Angry. Present Impunity, is the
  deepest Revenge. But <span class="pagenum" id="page274">{274}</span>when he cuts off the Supplies
  of Luxury, and disables the Powers of Extravagance, then as one may say, he is mercifully
  severe.'</p>

  <p>In his <i>1st.</i> Book <i>de consensu Evangelistarum</i>,<span class="leftmar"><i>cap.
  33.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref498"><a href="#side498">[498]</a></sup> He answers an
  objection of the <i>Heathens</i>, and comes up to the Case in Hand.</p>

  <p>'Their Complaint as if the Times were less happy since the Appearance of Christianity is very
  unreasonable. Let them read their own Philosophers: There they'l find those very Things censured,
  which they now are so uneasy to part with; This Remark must shut up their Mouths, and convince
  them of the Excellency of our Religion. For pray what Satisfactions have they lost? None that I
  know of, excepting some Licentious ones, which they abused to the Dishonour of their Creatour. But
  it may be the Times are bad because the <i>Theatres</i> are Tumbling almost every where. The
  <i>Theaters</i> those <i>Cages</i> of <i>Uncleaness</i>, and publick Schools of
  Debauchery.&mdash;&mdash;And what's the Reason of their running to Ruine? Why 'tis the Reformation
  of the Age: 'Tis because those Lewd Practises are out of Fashion, which first built and kept them
  in Countenance. Their own <i>Tully</i>'s Commendation of the <i>Actor Roscius</i> is remarkable.
  He was so much <span class="pagenum" id="page275">{275}</span>a Master (says he) that none but
  himself was worthy to Tread the <i>Stage</i>. And on the other hand, so good a Man, that he was
  the most unfit Person of the Gang to come There. And is not this a plain Confession of the
  Lewdness of the <i>Play-House</i>; And that the better a Man was, the more he was obliged to
  forbear it?'</p>

  <p>I could go on, much farther with St. <i>Augustine</i>, but I love to be as brief as may be. I
  could likewise run through the succeeding <i>Centuries</i>, and collect Evidence all along. But I
  conceive the best Ages, and the biggest Authorities, may be sufficient: And these the
  <i>Reader</i> has had already. However, one Instance more from the <i>Moderns</i> may not be
  amiss. <i>Didacus de Tapia</i> an eminent <i>Spaniard</i>, shall close the <i>Evidence</i>. This
  Author in debating the Question whether <i>Players</i> might be admitted to the <i>Sacrament</i>,
  amongst other things encounters an Objection. Some People it seems pretended there was some good
  to be learn'd at the <i>Play-House</i>. To these, he makes this reply.</p>

  <p>'Granting your Supposition, (says He) your Inference is naught. Do People use to send their
  Daughters to the <i>Stews</i> for Discipline? And yet it may be, they might meet some there
  lamenting their own Debauchery. No Man will breed his Son upon the <i>High-way</i>, to harden his
  <span class="pagenum" id="page276">{276}</span>Courage; Neither will any one go on board a Leaky
  Vessel, to learn the Art of shifting in a Wreck the better. My conclusion is, let no body go to
  the Infamous <i>Play-House</i>. A place of such staring Contradiction to the Strictness and
  Sobriety of Religion: A Place hated by God, and haunted by the Devil. Let no man I say learn to
  relish any thing that's said there; For 'tis all but Poyson handsomly prepared.' <span
  class="leftmar"><i>Didac. &amp;c. in D. Thom. p. 546.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref499"><a href="#side499">[499]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Thus I have presented the <i>Reader</i> with a short View of the Sense of <i>Christianity</i>.
  This was the opinion of the <i>Church</i> for the first 500 Years. And thus she has Censured the
  <i>Stage</i> both in <i>Councils</i>, and Single <i>Authorities</i>. And since the Satir of the
  <i>Fathers</i> comes full upon the <i>Modern Poets</i>, their Caution must be applicable. The
  parity of the Case makes their Reasons take place, and their Authority revive upon us. If we are
  <i>Christians</i>, the <i>Canons</i> of <i>Councils</i>, and the Sense of the Primitive
  <i>Church</i> must have a weight. The very Time is a good argument of it self. Then the
  <i>Apostolical Traditions</i> were fresh, and undisputed; and the <i>Church</i> much better agreed
  than she has been since. Then, Discipline was in Force, and Virtue Flourish'd, and People lived up
  to their <i>Profession</i>. And as for the <i>Persons</i>, they are beyond all exception. Their
  <i>Station</i>, their <span class="pagenum" id="page277">{277}</span>Learning, and Sufficiency was
  very Considerable; Their Piety and Resolution, extraordinary. They acted generously, and wrote
  freely, and were always above the little Regards of Interest or Danger. To be short; They were, as
  we may say the <i>Worthies</i> of <i>Christendom</i>, the Flower of Humane Nature, and the Top of
  their <i>Species</i>. Nothing can be better establish'd, than the Credit of these <i>Fathers</i>:
  Their Affirmation goes a great way in a proof; And we might argue upon the strength of their
  <i>Character</i>.</p>

  <p>But supposing them contented to wave their Privilege, and dispute upon the Level. Granting
  this, the <i>Stage</i> would be undone by them. The Force of their Reasoning, and the bare
  <i>Intrinsick</i> of the Argument, would be abundantly sufficient to carry the Cause.</p>

  <p>But it may be objected, is the Resemblance exact between Old <i>Rome</i> and <i>London</i>,
  will the Paralel hold out, and has the <i>English Stage</i> any Thing so bad as the <i>Dancing</i>
  of the <i>Pantomimi</i>? I don't say that: The <i>Modern Gestures</i> tho' bold and Lewd too
  sometimes, are not altogether so scandalous as the <i>Roman</i>. Here then we can make them some
  little Abatement.</p>

  <p>And to go as far in their <i>Excuse</i> as we can, 'tis probable their <i>Musick</i> may not be
  altogether so exceptionable as that of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page278">{278}</span><i>Antients</i>. I don't say this part of the Entertainment is directly
  vitious, because I am not willing to Censure at Uncertainties. Those who frequent the
  <i>Play-House</i> are the most competent Judges: But this I must say, the Performances of this
  kind are much too fine for the <i>Place</i>. 'Twere to be wish'd that either the <i>Plays</i> were
  better, or the <i>Musick</i> worse. I'm sorry to see <i>Art</i> so meanly Prostituted: Atheism
  ought to have nothing Charming in its <i>Retinue</i>. 'Tis great Pity <i>Debauchery</i> should
  have the Assistance of a fine Hand, to whet the Appetite, and play it down.</p>

  <p>Now granting the <i>Play-House-Musick</i> not vitious in the Composition, yet the design of it
  is to refresh the <i>Idea</i>'s of the Action, to keep <i>Time</i> with the <i>Poem</i>, and be
  true to the <i>Subject</i>. For this Reason among others the <i>Tunes</i> are generally Airy and
  Gailliardizing; They are contriv'd on purpose to excite a sportive Humour, and spread a Gaity upon
  the Spirits. To banish all Gravity and Scruple, and lay Thinking and Reflection a sleep. This sort
  of Musick warms the Passions, and unlocks the Fancy, and makes it open to Pleasure like a Flower
  to the Sun. It helps a Luscious Sentence to slide, drowns the Discords of <i>Atheism</i>, and
  keeps off the Aversions of Conscience. It throws a Man off his Guard, makes way for an ill
  Impresion, and is most <span class="pagenum" id="page279">{279}</span>Commodiously planted to do
  Mischief. A Lewd <i>Play</i> with good Musick is like a Loadstone <i>Arm'd</i>, it draws much
  stronger than before.</p>

  <p>Now why should it be in the power of a few mercenary Hands to play People out of their Senses,
  to run away with their Understandings, and wind their Passions about their Fingers as they list?
  Musick is almost as dangerous as Gunpowder; And it may be requires looking after no less than the
  <i>Press</i>, or the <i>Mint</i>. 'Tis possible a Publick Regulation might not be amiss. No less a
  Philosopher than <i>Plato</i> seems to be of this Opinion. He is clearly for keeping up the old
  grave, and solemn way of <i>Playing</i>. He lays a mighty stress upon this Observation: He does
  not stick to affirm, that to extend the <i>Science</i>, and alter the <i>Notes</i>, is the way to
  have the <i>Laws</i> repeal'd and to unsettle the <i>Constitution</i>.<span class="leftmar"><i>De
  Repub. L. 4.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref500"><a href="#side500">[500]</a></sup> I
  suppose He imagined that if the Power of <i>Sounds</i>, the Temper of Constitutions, and the
  Diversities of Age, were well studied; If this were done, and some general Permissions formed upon
  the Enquiry, the <i>Commonwealth</i> might find their Account in't.</p>

  <p><i>Tully</i> does not carry the Speculation thus high: However, he owns it has a weight in't,
  and should not be overlook'd.<span class="leftmar"><i>Cic. de Leg. L. 2.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref501"><a href="#side501">[501]</a></sup> He denies not but that when the
  Musick is soft, <span class="pagenum" id="page280">{280}</span>exquisite, and airy, 'tis dangerous
  and ensnaring. He commends the Discipline of the ancient <i>Greeks</i>, for fencing against this
  Inconvenience. He tells us the <i>Lacedemonians</i> fixt the number of Strings for the Harp, by
  express <i>Law</i>. And afterwards silenc'd <i>Timotheus</i>,<span class="nothand">*</span><span
  class="leftmar">* <i>A Famous Musician</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref502"><a
  href="#side502">[502]</a></sup> and seiz'd his Harp, for having One String above publick
  Allowance. To return. If the <i>English Stage</i> is more reserv'd than the <i>Roman</i> in the
  Case above mention'd: If they have any advantage in their <i>Instrumental</i> Musick, they loose
  it in their <i>Vocal</i>. Their <i>Songs</i> are often rampantly Lewd, and Irreligious to a
  flaming Excess. Here you have the very <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Essence</i> of Vice drawn off strong
  scented, and thrown into a little Compass. Now the <i>Antients</i> as we have seen already were
  inoffensive in this respect.</p>

  <p>To go on. As to Rankness of Language we have seen how deeply the <i>Moderns</i> stand charged
  upon the Comparison. And as for their Caressing of Libertines, their ridiculing of Vertue, their
  horrible Profaness, and Blasphemies, there's nothing in <i>Antiquity</i> can reach them.</p>

  <p>Now were the <i>Stage</i> in a Condition to wipe off any of these Imputations, which They are
  not, there are two Things besides which would stick upon them, and [......] an ill Effect upon the
  <i>Audience</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page281">{281}</span></div>

  <p>The first is their dilating so much upon the Argument of Love.</p>

  <p>This Subject is generally treated Home, and in the most tender and passionate manner
  imaginable. Tis often the governing Concern: The Incidents make way, and the <i>Plot</i> turns
  upon't. As matters go, the Company expect it: And it may be the <i>Poets</i> can neither Write,
  nor Live without it. This is a cunning way enough of stealing upon the Blind Side, and Practising
  upon the Weakness of humane Nature. People love to see their <i>Passions</i> painted no less than
  their <i>Persons</i>: And like <i>Narcissus</i> are apt to dote on their own Image. This Bent of
  self Admiration recommends the Business of <i>Amours</i>, and engages the Inclination. And which
  is more, these Love-representations oftentimes call up the Spirits, and set them on work. The
  <i>Play</i> is acted over again in the <i>Scene</i> of Fancy, and the first Imitation becomes a
  Model. <i>Love</i> has generally a <i>Party Within</i>; And when the Wax is prepared, the
  Impression is easily made. Thus the Disease of the Stage grows Catching: It throws its own
  <i>Amours</i> among the Company, and forms these Passions when it does not find them. And when
  they are born before, they thrive extreamly in this <i>Nursery</i>. Here they seldom fail either
  of Grouth, or Complexion. <span class="pagenum" id="page282">{282}</span>They grow strong, and
  they grow Charming too. This is the best Place to recover a Languishing Amour, to rowse it from
  Sleep, and retrieve it from Indifference. And thus Desire becomes Absolute, and forces the
  Oppositions of Decency and Shame. And if the Misfortune does not go thus far, the consequences are
  none of the best. The Passions are up in Arms, and there's a mighty Contest between Duty, and
  Inclination. The Mind is over-run with Amusements, and commonly good for nothing sometime
  after.</p>

  <p>I don't say the <i>Stage</i> Fells all before them, and disables the whole <i>Audience</i>:
  'Tis a hard Battle where none escapes. However, Their <i>Triumphs</i> and their <i>Tropheys</i>
  are unspeakable. Neither need we much wonder at the Matter. They are dangerously Prepar'd for
  Conquest, and Empire. There's Nature, and Passion, and Life, in all the Circumstances of their
  <i>Action</i>. Their Declamation, their <i>Mein</i> their Gestures, and their Equipage, are very
  moving and significant. Now when the Subject is agreeable, a lively Representation, and a
  Passionate way of Expression, make wild work, and have a strange Force upon the Blood, and
  Temper.</p>

  <p>And then as for the General Strains of Courtship, there can be nothing more Profane and
  extravagant. The Hero's Mistress <span class="pagenum" id="page283">{283}</span>is no less than
  his Deity. She disposes of his Reason, prescribes his Motions, and Commands his Interest. What
  Soveraign Respect, what Religious Address, what Idolizing Raptures are we pester'd with?
  <i>Shrines</i> and <i>Offerings</i> and Adorations, are nothing upon such solemn Occasions. Thus
  Love and Devotion, Ceremony and Worship are Confounded; And God, and his Creatures treated both
  alike! These Shreds of Distraction are often brought from the <i>Play-House</i> into Conversation:
  And thus the <i>Sparks</i> are taught to Court their Mistresses, in the same Language they say
  their <i>Prayers</i>.</p>

  <p>A Second Thing which I have to object against the <i>Stage</i> is their encouraging Revenge.
  What is more Common than Duels and Quarrelling in their <i>Characters</i> of Figure? Those
  Practises which are infamous in Reason, <i>Capital</i> in <i>Law</i>, and Damnable in Religion,
  are the Credit of the <i>Stage</i>. Thus Rage and Resentment, Blood and Barbarity, are almost
  Deified: Pride goes for Greatness, and <i>Fiends</i> and <i>Hero's</i> are made of the same
  Mettal. To give Instances were needless, nothing is more frequent. And in this respect the
  <i>French Dramatists</i> have been to blame no less than the <i>English</i>.<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Vid. Corneille Cid, Cinna &amp; Pompee.</i></span><sup class="handonly"
  id="ref503"><a href="#side503">[503]</a></sup> And thus the Notion of Honour is mistated, the
  Maxims of Christianity despised, and the Peace of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page284">{284}</span>World disturb'd. I grant this desperate Custom is no <i>Original</i> of
  the <i>Stage</i>. But then why was not the Growth of it check'd? I thought the <i>Poets</i>
  business had not been to back false Reasoning and ill Practise; and to fix us in Frensy and
  Mistake! Yes. They have done their endeavour to cherish the Malignity, and keep the Disorder in
  Countenance. They have made it both the Mark, and the Merit of a Man of Honour; and set it off
  with <i>Quality</i>, and Commendation. But I have discours'd on this Subject elswhere,<span
  class="leftmar"><i>Moral Essays.</i></span><sup class="handonly" id="ref504"><a
  href="#side504">[504]</a></sup> and therefore shall pursue it no farther.</p>

  <p>To draw towards an End. And here I must observe that these two later Exceptions are but Petty
  Mismanagements with respect to the Former. And when the best are thus bad, what are the worst?
  What must we say of the more foul Representations, of all the Impudence in Language and Gesture?
  Can this Stuff be the Inclination of <i>Ladies</i>? Is a <i>Reading</i> upon Vice so Entertaining,
  and do they love to see the <i>Stews Dissected</i> before them? One would think the Dishonour of
  their own Sex, the Discovery of so much Lewdness, and the treating Human Nature so very Coarsly,
  could have little Satisfaction in't. Let us set Conscience aside, and throw the other World out of
  the Question: These Interests are but the greatest, but not all. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page285">{285}</span><i>Ladies</i> have other Motives to confine them. The Restraints of
  Decency, and the Considerations of Honour, are sufficient to keep them at Home. But hoping They
  will be just to themselves I shall wave this unacceptable Argument. I shall only add, that a
  Surprize ought not to be Censured. Accidents are no Faults. The strictest Virtue may sometimes
  stumble upon an <i>Ill Sight</i>. But Choise, and Frequency, and ill Ground, conclude strongly for
  Inclination. To be assured of the inoffensiveness of the <i>Play</i> is no more than a Necessary
  Precaution. Indeed the <i>Players</i> should be generally discouraged. They have no relish of
  Modesty, nor any scruples upon the Quality of the Treat. The grossest <i>Dish</i> when 'twill down
  is as ready as the Best. To say Money is their Business and they must <i>Live</i>, is the Plea of
  <i>Pick pockets</i>, and <i>High way men</i>. These later may as well pretend their
  <i>Vocation</i> for a Lewd practise as the other. But</p>

  <p>To give the Charge its due Compass: To comprehend the whole <i>Audience</i>, and take in the
  Motives of Religon.</p>

  <p>And here I can't imagine how we can reconcile such Liberties with our Profession. These
  Entertainments are as it were Litterally renounc'd in <i>Baptism</i>. They are the <i>Vanities of
  the wicked World, and the Works of the Devil</i>, in the most open, and emphatical Signification.
  <i>What Communion <span class="pagenum" id="page286">{286}</span>has Light with Darkness, and what
  concord has Christ with Belial.</i><span class="leftmar"><i>2 Cor. 6. 14.</i></span><sup
  class="handonly" id="ref505"><a href="#side505">[505]</a></sup> Call you this Diversion? Can
  Profaness be such an irresistable Delight? Does the Crime of the Performance make the Spirit of
  the Satisfaction, and is the Scorn of Christianity the Entertainment of Christians? Is it such a
  Pleasure to hear the <i>Scriptures</i> burlesqu'd? Is Ribaldry so very obliging, and
  <i>Atheism</i> so Charming a Quality? Are we indeed willing to quit the Privilege of our Nature;
  to surrender our <i>Charter</i> of Immortality, and throw up the Pretences to another Life? It may
  be so! But then we should do well to remember that <i>Nothing</i> is not in our Power. Our Desires
  did not make us, neither can they unmake us. But I hope our wishes are not so mean, and that we
  have a better sense of the Dignity of our <i>Being</i>. And if so, how can we be pleas'd with
  those Things which would degrade us into Brutes, which ridicule our <i>Creed</i>, and turn all our
  Expectations into <i>Romance</i>.</p>

  <p>And after all, the Jest on't is, these Men would make us believe their design is Virtue and
  Reformation. In good time! They are likely to combat Vice with success, who destroy the Principles
  of Good and Evil! Take them at the best, and they do no more than expose a little Humour, and
  Formality. But then, as the Matter is manag'd, the Correction is much worse <span class="pagenum"
  id="page287">{287}</span>than the Fault. They laugh at <i>Pedantry</i>, and teach <i>Atheism</i>,
  cure a Pimple, and give the Plague. I heartily wish they would have let us alone. To exchange
  Virtue for Behaviour is a hard Bargain. Is not plain Honesty much better than Hypocrisy well
  Dress'd? What's Sight good for without Substance? What is a well Bred Libertine but a well bred
  Knave? One that can't prefer Conscience to Pleasure, without calling himself Fool: And will sell
  his Friend, or his Father, if need be, for his Convenience.</p>

  <p>In short: Nothing can be more disserviceable to Probity and Religion, than the management of
  the <i>Stage</i>. It cherishes those Passions, and rewards those Vices, which 'tis the business of
  Reason to discountenance. It strikes at the Root of Principle, draws off the Inclinations from
  Virtue, and spoils good Education: 'Tis the most effectual means to baffle the Force of
  Discipline, to emasculate peoples Spirits, and Debauch their Manners. How <i>many</i> of the
  Unwary have these <i>Syrens</i> devour'd? And how often has the best Blood been tainted, with this
  Infection? What Disappointment of Parents, what Confusion in Families, and What Beggery in Estates
  have been hence occasion'd? And which is still worse, the Mischief spreads dayly, and the
  Malignity grows more envenom'd. <span class="pagenum" id="page288">{288}</span>The Feavour works
  up towards Madness; and will scarcely endure to be touch'd. And what hope is there of Health when
  the <i>Patient</i> strikes in with the Disease, and flies in the Face of the <i>Remedy</i>? Can
  Religion retrive us? Yes, when we don't despise it. But while our <i>Notions</i> are naught, our
  <i>Lives</i> will hardly be otherwise. What can the Assistance of the Church signify to those who
  are more ready to Rally the <i>Preacher</i>, than Practise the <i>Sermon</i>? To those who are
  overgrown with Pleasure, and hardned in Ill Custom? Who have neither Patience to hear, nor
  Conscience to take hold of? You may almost as well feed a Man without a Mouth, as give Advice
  where there's no disposition to receive it. 'Tis true; as long as there is Life there's Hope.
  Sometimes the Force of Argument, and the Grace of God, and the anguish of Affliction, may strike
  through the Prejudice, and make their way into the Soul. But these circumstances don't always
  meet, and then the Case is extreamly dangerous. For this miserable Temper, we may thank the
  <i>Stage</i> in a great Measure: And therefore, if I mistake not, They have the least pretence to
  Favour, and the most, need of Repentance, of all Men Living.</p>
